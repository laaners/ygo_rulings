      <p><strong>1. Card Name</strong>\ This is the card&#39;s name. When a card name is mentioned in card text it appears in quotations. If cards have the same name, they are considered to be the same card.</p>
      <p><strong>2. Level</strong>\ Count the number of stars here to find out the monster&#39;s Level. For Xyz Monsters, the number of stars is the Rank of the monster, and is on left.</p>
      <p><strong>3. Attribute</strong></p>
      <div align="center">
        <img loading="lazy" src="./images/attributes.png" width="180" />
      </div>

      <p>Every monster has an Attribute. This Attribute is sometimes important for card effects.</p>
      <p><strong>4. Type</strong>\ Monsters are divided into various Types. Some monsters with specific abilities will have additional information here too, next to their Type.</p>
      <p><strong>5. Card Number</strong>\ A card&#39;s identification number is found here. This number is useful for collecting, and for sorting your collection.</p>
      <p><strong>6. ATK (Attack Points)/DEF (Defense Points)</strong>\ ATK is a monster&#39;s Attack Points and DEF is a monster&#39;s Defense Points. High Attack and Defense Points are good when battling!</p>
      <p><strong>7. Card Description</strong>\ Card effects are written here, describing the monster&#39;s special abilities and how to use them. Normally, the effects of monsters cannot be used while they are Set face-down on the field. Yellow Normal Monster Cards do not have effects, and have a description of them written here that does not affect the game.</p>
      <p>There are many kinds of Monster Cards. This game is more than a simple slugfest, so monsters with high Attack and Defense Points will not be enough. There are also monsters with strong special effects even though their ATK and DEF points are low. Therefore, your success in a Duel depends on how skillfully you can make use of the different kinds of cards.</p>

        When activating a card (1) that has an effect that performs a Ritual Summon from the Graveyard for example, a valid Ritual Monster (2) must be present in the Graveyard. If you tribute a Ritual Monster (3) so that it meets the requirements to Summon (2) from the Graveyard, if (3) will be sent to the Graveyard as a result and (3) is also a valid target that can be Summoned with (1), you
        <strong>cannot</strong> Summon (3) from the Graveyard.

              A Link Monster are monsters with the ability to increase the number of monsters you can Summon from your Extra Deck for other Link monsters and Pendulum monsters. In addition to the 1 Extra Monster Zone you can usually use, you can also Summon Link and Pendulum monsters from the Extra Deck to any of your Main Monster Zones that has a Link Monster&#39;s red arrow pointing to it.

              If 2 Extra Monster Zones are available, you can choose either one to Summon your monster. If there is a Link Monster already on the field, you can Link Summon a monster in one of your Zones it points to.

      Link and Pendulum Monsters Summoned from the Extra Deck normally have to go in the Extra Monster Zone. But Link Monsters open up more Zones for you to use, because every Main Monster Zone that a Link Monster points to can also be used to Summon Link and Pendulum monsters from your Extra Deck. Link and Pendulum Monsters that started in the Extra Deck, but later end up in the Graveyard (or are banished) and are Summoned from there, also go in the Main Monster Zones (and don&#39;t need a Link Monster to point to them).

      Some common terms to know when dealing with Link Monsters: -
      <strong>Link Arrows</strong>: these are the big red triangles surrounding the picture of the monster. Only the red ones are Link Arrows. - <strong>Link Rating</strong>: the number in the lower right hand corner of a Link Monster where the DEF would normally be located. This is the number of Link Arrows the monster has, and also the number of Link Materials you need to use to Link Summon it. - <strong>Link Material</strong>: these are the face-up monsters on your side of the field that you use to Link Summon. - <strong>points to</strong>: the Monster Zones and/or monsters that are directly adjacent to the tip of a Link Arrow are the zones and/or monsters that Link Monster &quot;points to&quot;. A Decode Talker placed in an Extra Monster Zone, for example, points to the Main Monster Zone directly above it, as well as the Main Monster Zones diagonally downwards to the left and right. A Decode Talker placed in the center Main Monster Zone does not point to anything, as there are no Monster Zones directly adjacent to the tip of its Link Arrows. - <strong>linked</strong>: a monster is &quot;linked&quot; if one or both of the following is true: 1. A Link Arrow is pointing to this monster. 2. This monster is a Link Monster and one of its Link Arrows is pointing to another monster. - <strong>co-linked</strong>: only Link Monsters can be &quot;co-linked&quot;. Two Link Monsters are &quot;co-linked&quot; if they have Link Arrows that point at each other. In the following formation, Firewall Dragon is &quot;co-linked&quot; to 2 monsters: Link Spider and Honeybot.

      <section-header level="3" id="extra-link">Extra Link</section-header>
      <p>In addition to being linked or co-linked, there&#39;s a special type of &quot;linked&quot; state that a monster can be in: &quot;Extra Linked&quot;. Only Link Monsters can be Extra Linked, and this state only occurs when a series of co-linked Link Monsters is built that connects a Link Monster in an Extra Monster Zone to a Link Monster in the other Extra Monster Zone. Each monster in the series must be co-linked to each other monster it is linked to in the series.</p>
      <p>In the example below, we&#39;ve placed a series of co-linked monsters from the right-hand Extra Monster Zone over to the left-hand Extra Monster Zone where the opponent has Link Summoned &quot;Decode Talker&quot;. Each of our Link Monsters is co-linked to each other Link Monster it&#39;s linked to in the series, so when we Link Summon the final monster in the series, each monster in the series becomes Extra Linked in addition to being co-linked and linked, including the opponent&#39;s &quot;Decode Talker&quot;. Any Link Monster that is co-linked to one of the monsters in this series is also Extra Linked, even if it&#39;s not contributing towards making the monsters Extra Linked. For example, an extra &quot;Honeybot&quot; to the left or right of one of the &quot;Firewall Dragons&quot; would also be Extra Linked.</p>
      <div align="center">
        <img loading="lazy" src="./images/extra_link.png" width="500" />
      </div>

      <p>Under normal circumstances you cannot occupy both Extra Monster Zones with monsters from your Extra Deck. There is one, and only one, exception to this rule: If Link Summoning to the second Extra Monster Zone would create a complete series of Extra Linked Link Monsters, you may Link Summon a monster to that Extra Monster Zone to complete that series. So in the example below, you are allowed to Link Summon a monster to the left-hand Extra Monster Zone if and only if that monster would be co-linked to the left-hand &quot;Firewall Dragon&quot;, causing all of the monsters to become Extra Linked.</p>
      <div align="center">
        <img loading="lazy" src="./images/extra_link_2.png" width="500" />
      </div>

      <p><strong>Link Monsters can be co-linked on diagonals</strong>, an Extra Link with only three monsters is then possible as well.</p>

      <p>Normally, 1 monster equals 1 Link Material. But when you use a Link Monster as material for another Link Summon, you can count it as either 1 monster, or as a number of monsters equal to its Link Rating. For example, if you want to Summon a Link 3 monster that requires 2 or more materials in its &quot;recipe&quot;, you can either use 3 monsters (each counts as 1 material) or else a Link 2 Link Monster (counts as 1 or 2 materials) and a second monster (counts as 1 material).</p>

      <section-header level="1" id="summoning">Summoning</section-header>
      <p>There are several ways to play monsters onto the field. These ways can be categorized into 2 groups: actions that can be done only once per turn, and actions that can be done multiple times per turn:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>You can do one of these once per turn</strong>:
          <ul>
            <li>Normal Summon</li>
            <li>Normal Set</li>
            <li>Tribute Summon</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>You can do as many of these during a turn as you want</strong>:
          <ul>
            <li>Flip Summon</li>
            <li>Special Summon</li>

      <section-header level="2" id="normal-summon">Normal Summon</section-header>
      <p>This is the most common way to Summon a monster. Simply play a Monster Card from your hand onto the field in face-up Attack Position. All Normal Monsters, and most Effect Monsters (unless they have a specific restriction), can be Summoned in this way.</p>

      <p>To play a Monster Card from your hand in face-down Defense Position is called a Normal Set.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A monster Normal Set on the field is NOT considered Summoned.</li>
        <li>It has been Normal Set, and can be Summoned with a Flip Summon or flipped face-up by an attack or card effect.</li>
        <li>Remember, you can only Normal Summon OR Normal Set (Normal Summon/Set, in short), once per turn, so if you Normal Set a monster you cannot also Normal Summon a monster that turn.</li>

      <p>For monsters that are Level 5 or higher, you must Tribute at least 1 monster you control before the Normal Summon/Set. This is called a Tribute Summon. Monsters that are Level 5 or 6 require 1 Tribute and Monsters that are Level 7 or higher require 2 Tributes</p>
      <div align="center">| Level 5, 6 | Level 7 or higher | | ---------- | ----------------- | | 1 Tribute | 2 Tributes |</div>

      <p>You can change a face-down Defense Position monster into face-up Attack Position, without using a card effect. This is called a Flip Summon.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>When you Flip Summon, you cannot change the monster to face-up Defense Position, only to face-up Attack Position.</li>
        <li>A Monster Card cannot be Flip Summoned in the same turn that it was Set onto the field.</li>

Link Summons, Pendulum Summons, Xyz Summons, Synchro Summons, Fusion Summons and Ritual Summons are all Special Summons. Some Effect Monsters also have specific conditions that allow you to Special Summon them. Unless otherwise specified, a Special Summoned monster is played onto the field in your choice of face-up Attack Position or face-up Defense Position.</p>

      <p><strong>5. Card Number</strong>\ A card&#39;s identification number is found here. This number is useful for collecting, and for sorting your collection.</p>
      <p>Spell Cards can normally be activated only during your Main Phase, and help you out with different effects. Spell Cards have many powerful effects, like destroying other cards or strengthening monsters. Save these cards in your hand until you can get the best results out of them.</p>

        Normal Spell Cards have single-use effects. To use a Normal Spell Card, announce its activation to your opponent, placing it face-up on the field. If the activation succeeds, then you resolve the effect written on the card. After resolving the effect, send the card to the Graveyard.

        These cards give an extra effect to 1 face-up monster of your choice (either your own or your opponent&#39;s, depending on the card). They remain on the field after they are activated. The Equip Spell Card affects only 1 monster (called the equipped monster), but still occupies one of your Spell &amp; Trap Zones. If the equipped monster is destroyed, flipped face-down, or removed from the field, its Equip Cards are destroyed.

        These cards go in your Field Zone and stay there. Each player can have 1 Field Spell Card on their own side of the field. To use another Field Spell, send your previous one to the Graveyard. These cards may be placed facedown in the Field Zone, but are not active until flipped face-up.

        These are special Spell Cards that can be activated during any Phase of your turn, not just your Main Phase. You can also activate them during your opponent&#39;s turn if you Set the card face-down first, but then you cannot activate the card in the same turn you Set it.

      <section-header level="1" id="trap-cards">Trap cards</section-header>
      <p>Trap Cards will help you out with different effects, just like Spell Cards. The big difference between them is that you can activate Trap Cards during your opponent&#39;s turn. Before you can activate a Trap Card, you must Set it on the field first. You cannot activate a Trap in the same turn that you Set it, but you can activate it at any time after that-starting from the beginning of the next turn.</p>
      <p>Spell Cards can be Set face-down on the field like Trap Cards. However, the rules for the two types of cards are different. Spell Cards can be activated during the Main Phases even in the same turn that you Set them (except for Quick-Play Spell Cards). Setting them does not allow you to use them on your opponent&#39;s turn; they still can only be activated during your Main Phase. You can Set a Spell Card face-down on the field to bluff your opponent into thinking you have a powerful Trap.</p>

        Just like Continuous Spell Cards, Continuous Trap Cards remain on the field once they are activated and their effects continue while they are face-up on the field. Some Continuous Trap Cards have abilities similar to the Ignition Effects or Trigger Effects that can be found on Effect Monster Cards.

        These Trap Cards are normally activated in response to the activation of other cards, and may have abilities like negating the effects of those cards. These types of Traps are effective against Normal Spell Cards or Normal Trap Cards, which are otherwise hard to stop, however many Counter Trap Cards require a cost to activate them.

      <ul>
        <li>Limited cards are restricted to 1 copy in a Deck</li>
        <li>Semi-Limited cards are restricted to 2 copies in a Deck</li>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Can Summon or Set a monster</strong>. There is no limit to the number of times you can Flip Summon or Special Summon during a turn, but you can only Normal Summon or Set a monster (including a Tribute Summon) once per turn.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Can change their Monster&#39;s Battle Position</strong>. This includes Flip Summoning a monster, or changing the position of a face-up monster to face-up Attack or Defense Position. You can change the position of each monster you control, except in three cases:
          <ol>
            <li>You cannot change the battle position of a monster that was played onto the field this turn.</li>

        <li><strong>Can Set Spell and Trap Cards</strong>. You can Set Spell and Trap Cards face-down in your Spell &amp; Trap Zone during this phase, as long as you have space.</li>

      <p>After you&#39;ve announced your attacking monster and the attack target monster during a Battle Step, the attack target might be removed from the field, or a new monster may be played onto the opponent&#39;s side of the field before the Damage Step, due to a card&#39;s effect. This causes a &quot;Replay.&quot; When this occurs, you can choose to attack with the same monster again, or choose to attack with a different monster, or choose not to attack at all.</p>
      <p>Note that if you attack with a different monster, the first monster is still considered to have declared an attack, and it cannot attack again this turn.</p>

        ✔️ Spell/Trap Cards and <strong>Quick/Quick-like Effects</strong> that <strong>directly alter the ATK/DEF</strong> of a monster(s), but <strong>only up until damage calculation</strong>.

        ><sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-3">[3]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        $\hspace{2em}$✔️ These cards and effects do not have to affect a battling monster; they can be used during the Damage Step to affect the ATK/DEF of a monster(s) that is not currently battling<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-6">[6]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        $\hspace{2em}$❌ Optional Spell/Trap Cards and Quick/Quick-like Effects that can <strong>indirectly change the ATK/DEF</strong> of a monster (such as &quot;Reverse Trap&quot; or &quot;Skill Drain&quot;) <strong>cannot</strong> be activated during the Damage Step for that reason alone<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-7">[7]</a></sup
        ><sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-8">[8]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        $\hspace{2em}$✔️
        <strong>Trap Cards that equip themselves to monsters and have Continuous-like Effects that directly alter the ATK/DEF</strong>
        of the equipped monster, such as &quot;Horn of the Phantom Beast&quot;,
        <strong>can</strong> be activated during the Damage Step for that reason alone<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-9">[9]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        $\hspace{2em}$❌ Cards like &quot;Half or Nothing&quot;, which
        <strong>might not alter ATK/DEF at resolution, cannot</strong> be activated during the Damage Step for that reason alone<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-10">[10]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        $\hspace{2em}$❌ Cards such as &quot;Powerful Rebirth&quot; and &quot;Reverse of Neos&quot;, which Special Summon a monster and exclusively <strong>modify the ATK/DEF of that Summoned</strong> monster, <strong>cannot</strong> be activated during the Damage Step for that reason alone<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-11">[11]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        $\hspace{2em}$✔️ If a <strong>Set Continuous Trap Card</strong> has an
        <strong>optional Quick-like Effect that directly alters the ATK/DEF</strong>
        of a monster(s) (such as &quot;Attack of the Cornered Rat&quot;), that Trap Card <strong>can</strong> be activated during the Damage Step until damage calculation, but only if that Quick-like Effect is activated and resolved in the same Chain Link as the activation of the Trap Card itself<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-12">[12]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        $\hspace{2em}$✔️ <strong>Continuous Trap Cards</strong> with <strong>Continuous-like Effects that directly</strong> alter the ATK/DEF of a monster(s), such as &quot;Fire Formation - Kaiyo&quot;, <strong>can be activated</strong> during the Damage Step until damage calculation<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-13">[13]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        $\hspace{4em}$✔️ Such Trap Cards
        <strong>can be activated even if their relevant Continuous-like Effect would not affect any monsters</strong>, such as activating &quot;Dark Contract with the Witch&quot; during your own turn or while you control no Fiend-Type monsters, or activating &quot;Unpossessed&quot; when a monster other than a &quot;Familiar-Possessed&quot; monster is attacking
      </p>
      <p>
        $\hspace{4em}$✔️ Such Trap Cards can be activated even if their relevant Continuous-like Effect only applies an ATK/DEF change under particular conditions and those conditions are not currently met (such as activating &quot;Chosen of Zefra&quot; while there are fewer than 3 &quot;Zefra&quot; monsters face-up in your Extra Deck), unless that condition could never be met during the Damage Step (such as &quot;Swift Samurai Storm!&quot;)<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-14">[14]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        $\hspace{4em}$❌ Even if a Continuous Trap Card can be activated during the Damage Step due to having a Continuous-like Effect that alters ATK/DEF,
        <strong>if it also has a Quick-like Effect that can be activated in the same Chain Link as the activation of the Trap Card itself</strong>
        (such as &quot;Dark Contract with the Witch&quot;),
        <strong>that Quick-like Effect cannot be activated at the same time as the Trap Card&#39;s activation during the Damage Step</strong>, unless it has another valid reason allowing it to be activated during the Damage Step<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-15">[15]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        $\hspace{2em}$❌ Unique exceptions are &quot;Evil Blast&quot;<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-16">[16]</a></sup
        >, &quot;Scrap Sheen&quot;<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-17">[17]</a></sup> (TCG only), &quot;Zero Force&quot;<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-18">[18]</a></sup
        >, &quot;Curse of Anubis&quot;<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-19">[19]</a></sup
        >, and the Quick-like Effect of &quot;Rocket Hand&quot;<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-20">[20]</a></sup
        >, which have rulings stating that they cannot be activated during the Damage Step.
      </p>
      <p>
        $\hspace{2em}$❌ Unlike Quick/Quick-like Effects,
        <strong>having the effect of directly altering the ATK/DEF of a monster(s) does not permit optional Trigger/Trigger-like Effects to be activated during the Damage Step</strong>, with examples being &quot;Morpho Butterspy&quot;<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-21">[21]</a></sup>
        and &quot;Performapal Turn Toad&quot;
      </p>
      <p>
        ✔️ <strong>Optional Trigger and Trigger-like Effects</strong> (if that effect activates in response to the card itself being moved to a different location including leaving the field, being flipped face-up including Flip effects, or having its battle position changed<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-3">[3]</a></sup
        ><sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-22">[22]</a></sup
        >) <strong>can be activated during the Damage Step, unless the effect performs a Normal</strong><sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-23">[23]</a></sup> <strong>or Fusion Summon</strong><sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-24">[24]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        $\hspace{2em}$❌ In general, other
        <strong>optional Trigger and Trigger-like Effects that have activation conditions that can be met both during and outside the Damage Step cannot be activated</strong>. For cards that have Problem-Solving Card Text, these normally state &quot;(except during the Damage Step)&quot; (for exampl &quot;Fallen of Albaz&quot;) in their activation conditions. Otherwise, these effects are associated with activation conditions that involve actions regarding other cards, such as &quot;When/If a ... is destroyed&quot;, &quot;When/If a ... is added from ... to your hand&quot;, &quot;When/If a ... monster is Special Summoned&quot;, etc. of cards like &quot;Revival Rose&quot;, &quot;Ambulanceroid&quot;, and &quot;Cyber Dinosaur&quot;. This includes Trigger Effects of monsters that can activate in response to actions involving itself and/or other cards (but not just itself or other cards), such as &quot;Madolche Chickolates&quot;; they cannot be activated during the Damage Step.
      </p>
      <p>
        ✔️ Any effect that
        <strong>specifically mentions an activation timing that is unique to the Damage Step</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        $\hspace{2em}$✔️ This is indicated by phrases in the text such as
        <strong>&quot;During damage calculation&quot;, &quot;At the end of the Damage Step&quot;, &quot;If/When you take battle damage&quot;, etc.</strong>
        (this includes cards and effects that activate
        <strong>in response to damage, without specifying battle damage</strong>, like &quot;Blackfeather Darkrage Dragon&quot;, &quot;Attack and Receive&quot;, and &quot;Numinous Healer&quot;)
      </p>
      <p>
        $\hspace{2em}$✔️ If a
        <strong>Set Continuous Trap Card has an optional Trigger-like or optional Quick-like Effect with an activation timing at least partially specific to the Damage Step</strong>
        (such as &quot;Yang Zing Creation&quot; and &quot;Damage = Reptile&quot;), that Trap Card <strong>can</strong> be activated during the Damage Step if that Trigger-like/Quick-like Effect is also activated in the same Chain Link as the activation of the Trap Card itself<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-25">[25]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        $\hspace{2em}$❌ In contrast, if a
        <strong>Set Continuous Trap Card has a mandatory Trigger-like Effect with an activation timing at least partially specific to the Damage Step</strong>, the Trap Card itself <strong>cannot</strong> be activated, even if its controller intended on activating that Trigger-like Effect in the same Chain Link as the activation of the Trap Card itself<sup><a href="#cards_effects_that_can_be_activated_during_damage_step-26">[26]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>A card only needs to meet one of the above requirements to be activated during the Damage Step. As long as it does not explicitly specify (except during the Damage Step), even if it fails to satisfy one of the above requirements, if it satisfies another one it can be activated during the Damage Step. For example, &quot;Rope of Life&quot; Special Summons a monster and exclusively changes the ATK of the Summoned monster (like &quot;Reverse of Neos&quot;); cards with such effects cannot be activated during the Damage Step for that reason alone, but since &quot;Rope of Life&quot; also has an activation timing that is unique to the Damage Step (&quot;When a monster(s) is destroyed by battle and sent to your Graveyard:&quot;), it can be activated during the Damage Step.</p>

      <section-header level="2" id="chains">Chains</section-header>
      <p>Chains are a way to order the resolution of multiple card effects. They are used when the effects of more than 1 card are activated at once, or when a player wants to use an effect after a card has been played, but BEFORE that card has an effect on the game.</p>
      <p>If a card&#39;s effect is activated, the opponent is always given a chance to respond with a card effect of their own, creating a Chain. If your opponent responds with an effect, then you can choose to respond and add another effect to the Chain. If your opponent does not respond, you may activate a second effect and create a Chain to your own card&#39;s activation. Both players continue to add effects to the Chain until they both wish to add nothing else, then you resolve the outcome in reverse order - starting with the last card that was activated.</p>
      <div align="center">
        <img loading="lazy" src="./images/chain_diagram.png" width="250" />
      </div>
      As shown in the diagram, the first effect activated is Chain Link 1. The next effect is Chain Link 2, and so on. Every time a new Chain Link is made, they are stacked up in the order that the cards are activated. Once the Chain is completed, the outcome is resolved starting with the most recent card to be activated at the top of the Chain and proceeding down to Chain Link 1.

      <section-header level="3" id="spell_speed">Spell Speed</section-header>

      Every type of card effect has a Spell Speed between 1 and 3. If you want to respond to a card effect in a Chain, you have to use an effect with Spell Speed 2 or higher, and it cannot have a lower Spell Speed than the effect you are responding to. Spell, Trap, and Effect Monster effects have different Spell Speeds. There are Spell Speeds from 1 to 3. You can only respond with an effect if it is Spell Speed 2 or higher, and has an equal or greater Spell Speed than the effect on the Chain Link before it.

              This is the slowest of all Spell Speeds. These cards cannot be activated in response to any other effects. Typically, these effects cannot be Chain Link 2 or higher, unless multiple Spell Speed 1 effects are activated simultaneously.

      You can only create a Chain by responding to the activation of a card or effect. Summoning a monster, Tributing, changing a monster&#39;s battle position and paying costs are not effect activations and therefore you cannot respond to those actions using a Chain.

      <section-header level="3" id="spell_speed">Fast effect timing</section-header>

      Fast effects are card activations and effects with a Spell Speed of 2 or higher, including monster Quick Effects, Quick-Play Spell Cards, and Trap Cards (which includes both activating Trap Cards, and activating the effects of things like Continuous Trap Cards). Fast effects can be activated by either player - even during their opponent&#39;s turn, as long as the conditions are appropriate. When both players want to activate fast effects at the same time, they are placed on a Chain. Sometimes, it can make a big difference WHO places their fast effect on the Chain first: this can determine who &quot;goes next&quot;. - Usually, the turn player has the chance to &quot;go next&quot; and activate the next fast effect. - However, during a Chain, the chance to go next passes back and forth between players. - Also, if the turn player doesn&#39;t wish to take any actions, and instead wants to move along in the turn (for example, to the next Step or Phase), the opponent has an opportunity to go next, and activate a fast effect, before the turn proceeds. Follow the
      <a target="_blank" href="#fast_effect_timing_flowchart">chart</a> to see which player can &quot;go next&quot; regarding fast effects.

      Each Phase and Step starts with the turn player in box A of the chart listed below. This is when the game state is <strong>&quot;open&quot;</strong>, meaning the turn player has complete freedom of action. Many actions can ONLY be performed when the game state is open (when you&#39;re in box A). Examples: - Normal Summon (including Tribute Summon) - Set a card - Perform a Special Summon that does not start a Chain (including Xyz Summon, Synchro Summon) - Change a monster&#39;s Battle Position - Attempt to move to the next Phase/Step - Draw a card for your normal draw during the Draw Phase - Declare an attack - Activate an Ignition Effect - Activate a Spell Speed 1 Spell Card If the game state is &quot;open&quot;, the turn player may perform any of the above actions that is appropriate. They can also choose to activate a fast effect, if they wish. Whenever either player performs an action, the game state is no longer open, but <strong>&quot;closed&quot;</strong>. If the game state is &quot;closed&quot;, then only fast effects can be activated, dependent on Fast Effect Timing rules. When nothing is going on, and neither player wishes to do anything, the game state goes back to being &quot;open&quot;. Technically, this means: - IF the Turn Player has the chance to activate the next fast effect - AND the turn player passes to the opponent - AND the opponent then passes back - AND no Chain is currently being formed then the game state is open again.

      If the game state is open, and the turn player chooses not to do anything, and the opponent waives the chance to activate a fast effect, and both players agree to have the turn proceed, then you move to the next Phase or Step.

      <p>The turn player always starts with Priority, or the choice to activate a card first, in each phase or step of their turn. As long as the turn player has Priority, the opponent cannot activate cards or effects, except for effects that activate automatically, like Trigger or Flip effects. The turn player can either:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use Priority to play a card or activate an effect</li>
        <li>Pass Priority to the opponent so they can activate an effect.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A player must pass Priority to the opponent when moving on to the next phase or step. Strictly speaking, you would always declare that you&#39;re passing Priority before the end of every phase and step, and ask your opponent if they wish to play a card. However, for ease of play, announcing the end of your phases or steps implies giving up Priority. Therefore, when announcing the end of a phase, your opponent can just say &quot;Before the end of your phase, I activate this card&quot; and use a card.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The turn player starts with Priority to activate a card or effect first</li>
        <li>After a card&#39;s activation, and at the end of each phase or step, Priority passes to the opponent.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>If effects of Spell Speed 1 cards (like Trigger Effects) are activated at the same time, they will be resolved in a special Chain. This Chain is made starting with the turn player&#39;s mandatory effects. If there is only 1 effect, that will be Chain Link 1.</p>
      <p>If there are 2 or more effects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The turn player builds the Chain starting with their mandatory effects, in any order.</li>
        <li>Then the opponent continues the Chain with their mandatory effects in any order.</li>

      <p>There is a difference between optional effects that can be used &quot;If&quot; something happens and optional effects you can use &quot;When&quot; something happens.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cards that say you can do something
          <strong>&quot;When&quot;</strong> something happens must activate their effects immediately when that something occurs. If they cannot, or something happens between the time the condition is met and the next time cards or effects can be activated, then you miss your chance to use them.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cards that say you can do something
          <strong>&quot;If&quot;</strong> something happens must activate their effects at the first possible opportunity to activate cards or effects after the &quot;If&quot; condition is met.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Remember, this is only for <strong>optional effects</strong>. Effects that are mandatory, like &quot;The White Stone of Legend&quot;, will always activate even though they say &quot;When&quot;.</p>

      <section-header level="1" id="card-text">Card text</section-header>
      <section-header level="2" id="problem-solving-card-text-psct-">Problem Solving Card Text (PSCT)</section-header>
      <p>
        Problem-Solving Card Text (often abbreviated PSCT) is a method of writing card text used for prints released from July 8, 2011 onward. The purpose of Problem-Solving Card Text is to specify card effects to the point that most situations can be resolved by logically interpreting the card text<sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-1">[1]</a></sup
        >.
      </p>
      <p>Problem-Solving Card Text uses specific words with very particular meanings in the context of gameplay. How to interpret the text is important to understanding how to apply card text to the game.</p>
      <p>This interpretation can only be applied for cards that use Problem-Solving Card Text. Cards that were printed with earlier text may use some of the same terms or structures, but this does not necessarily mean that they work as if they were Problem-Solving Card Text.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          All card effects that make a Chain Link include a colon &quot;:&quot; or a semicolon &quot;;&quot; somewhere in their text (possibly both). If a card effect does not use either, it does not make a Chain Link<sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-3">[3]</a></sup
          >.
          <ul>
            <li>
              The activation of a Spell or Trap Card always makes a Chain Link, but its effect that resolves with the card itself (if any) does not necessarily use a colon or semicolon<sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-3">[3]</a></sup
              >. This effect is usually the first effect listed in the card&#39;s text.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Text before the <strong>colon</strong> &quot;:&quot; describes <strong>activation conditions</strong> (limits on when or how often a card or effect can be activated<sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-3">[3]</a></sup
          ><sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-7">[7]</a></sup
          >). These conditions only need to be met when the card is activated<sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-4">[4]</a></sup
          >.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Conditions other than target requirements that have to be met during both activation and resolution are specifically noted in a separate sentence after the effect sentence (e.g. &quot;Zombie Master&quot;, &quot;Treeborn Frog&quot;)<sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-4">[4]</a></sup
              >.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Text before the <strong>semicolon</strong> &quot;;&quot; (but after the colon, if any) describes anything that happens when that card or effect is activated (such as <strong>costs and targeting</strong><sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-3">[3]</a></sup
          ><sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-7">[7]</a></sup
          >).
        </li>
        <li>
          Built-In Special Summons (other than Synchro, Xyz, Pendulum, or Link) are denoted by parentheses &quot;()&quot; stating the location from which the monster can be Special Summoned<sup><a href="#psct_text_structure-5">[5]</a></sup
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cards with bulleted effects (●) that resolve in the same Chain Link specify whether they resolve simultaneously or sequentially (if sequentially, effects are applied in the order they are listed). In these cases, each effect activated resolves independent of the success of the other(s).
          <ul>
            <li>The text &quot;in sequence&quot; indicates that the bulleted effects are applied sequentially (e.g. &quot;Gravekeeper&#39;s Oracle&quot;, &quot;Advance Zone&quot;).</li>
            <li>The text &quot;(simultaneously)&quot; indicates that the bulleted effects are applied simultaneously (e.g. &quot;Ryko, Lightsworn Hunter&quot;, &quot;Kunai with Chain&quot;).</li>
            <li>If neither is specified, the effects each make separate Chain Links (e.g. &quot;Metaphys Horus&quot;).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <section-header level="3" id="activation-condition-requirement">Activation condition/requirement</section-header>
      <p>An activation condition, also known as its activation requirement, is the set of conditions that must be met in order to activate a card or effect.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Unless otherwise specified, the activation conditions only need to be satisfied when the card is activated, not when it resolves.</li>
        <li>On cards with Problem-Solving Card Text, the activation condition is written before a colon &quot;:&quot;, at the start of a card effect.</li>
      </ul>

      </ol>

      <section-header level="3" id="cost">Cost</section-header>
      <p>A cost is an action that must be performed in order to activate a card or effect, to perform another action, or to keep a card on the field. This is distinct from activation requirements, which are requirements that must be met in order to activate a card or effect.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Costs usually involve the player making a sacrifice of some type, such as paying Life Points (e.g. &quot;Seven Tools of the Bandit&quot; requires the player to pay 1000 Life Points), discarding, Tributing, banishing, detaching a card(s) or sending a card(s) to the Graveyard</li>
        <li>If a cost cannot be fully paid, none of the cost can be paid and the effect cannot be activated.</li>
        <li>A cost is not an effect. If a card is moved to a different location due to a cost, cards and effects that can only be activated when the card is moved by a card effect cannot be activated. For example, the effect of &quot;Shaddoll Dragon&quot; cannot be activated if it is sent to the Graveyard as a cost to activate &quot;Phoenix Wing Wind Blast&quot;.</li>
        <li>Even if a card&#39;s effect is being negated (such as by &quot;Skill Drain&quot;), it is still possible to activate its effects (which would require paying the cost).</li>
        <li>On cards with Problem-Solving Card Text, the cost is written before a semicolon &quot;;&quot;, at the start of a card effect or after the activation condition.</li>
      </ul>

      <section-header level="4" id="maintenance-cost">Maintenance cost</section-header>
      <p>A maintenance cost is a cost required to keep a card on the field. They are typically paid during a player&#39;s Standby Phase or End Phase. If a player does not, or cannot, pay the maintenance cost of a card, then it will destroy itself (with the exception of &quot;Gaia Plate the Earth Giant&quot; and &quot;Aerial Recharge&quot;, which simply send themselves to the Graveyard).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintenance costs are not effects, so they cannot be negated and do not activate or start a Chain Link; even if a card like &quot;Skill Drain&quot; or &quot;Jinzo&quot; is on the field and negating the card&#39;s effects, its maintenance cost still needs to be paid.</li>
        <li>Cards such as &quot;Card Guard&quot; and &quot;Field Barrier&quot; cannot protect these cards from destroying themselves due to not paying their maintenance cost, since it is not treated as being destroyed by a card effect.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>For <strong>mandatory</strong> maintenance costs (such as &quot;Imperial Order&quot;, &quot;Degenerate Circuit&quot;, &quot;Destructive Draw&quot;, &quot;Mind Protector&quot;, &quot;Red Screen&quot;, &quot;Number 41: Bagooska the Terribly Tired Tapir&quot;), the player does not have the option of choosing not to pay the cost and letting the card be destroyed.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If a mandatory maintenance cost requires LP and the player has exactly the specified amount left, since they must pay, they lose the Duel when the cost comes up due to reaching 0 LP (e.g. when the controller of &quot;Imperial Order&quot; happens to have 700 LP during the Standby Phase).</li>

      <section-header level="3" id="target">Target</section-header>
      <p>Targeting is the action of designating which specific cards are affected or used by card effects at the activation of a card effect.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Cards can be targeted if they are on the field, in the Graveyard, or banished. Cards in the hand, Main Deck, Extra Deck<sup><a href="#target_pendulum">[1]</a></sup
          >, or attached as Xyz Material cannot be targeted.
        </li>
        <li>In Problem-Solving Card Text, cards and effects that target always explicitly state that they target: a card targets if and only if it uses the word &quot;target&quot;.</li>
        <li>If a card or effect targets, its targets must be chosen when it is activated.</li>

      <p>In order to activate a card (1) with a cost to pay and targets another card (2) for its effect (for example target (2) and Summon it from the Graveyard), a correct target (2) must be present (on the field, in the Graveyard, ...) before attempting (1)&#39;s activation. Even if a valid target would be created after paying (1)&#39;s cost, (1) cannot be activated.</p>

        The conjunctives &quot;and&quot;, &quot;and if you do&quot;, &quot;also&quot;, and &quot;then&quot; have specific meanings<sup><a href="#psct_conjunctives-1">[1]</a></sup
        >:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In &quot;Do A, <strong>then</strong> do B&quot;, B happens after A. These things happen in sequence, not simultaneously. A is required for B, but NOT vice-versa: if A does not happen, then stop; even if B cannot happen, you still do A<sup><a href="#psct_conjunctives-1">[1]</a></sup
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          In &quot;Do A <strong>and</strong> B&quot;, both A and B happen simultaneously. BOTH A and B are required. If you cannot do both, you do nothing<sup><a href="#psct_conjunctives-1">[1]</a></sup
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          In &quot;Do A, <strong>and if you do</strong>, do B&quot;, both A and B happen simultaneously. A is required for B, but NOT vice-versa: if A does not happen, then stop; even if B cannot happen, you still do A<sup><a href="#psct_conjunctives-1">[1]</a></sup

        </li>
        <li>
          In &quot;Do A, <strong>also</strong> do B&quot;, both A and B happen simultaneously. Neither is required for the other to occur<sup><a href="#psct_conjunctives-1">[1]</a></sup

        </li>
        <li>In &quot;Do A, <strong>also, after that</strong>, do B&quot;, B happens after A. These things happen in sequence, not simultaneously. Neither is required for the other to occur (This conjunctive was never discussed in the Problem-Solving Card Text articles, as it was not introduced until 2014).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There is no conjunctive that indicates both parts of the effect are required while also indicating that the parts are not simultaneous. While this relationship is rare, it does occur for some effects—in particular, Fusion Summoning and Ritual Summoning effects, which normally text structures unique to that Summoning method, which do not use conjunctives at all for that part of their text. The card &quot;Luminous Dragon Ritual&quot; uniquely indicates this relationship with the conjunctive &quot;and&quot; followed by &quot;after that&quot; at the end of the second part of the effect.</p>

      <p>While Rivalry/Gozen is active and you have a face-up monster, you cannot Summon monsters that are a different Type/Attribute from the monster(s) you already control.</p>
      <p>So you can&#39;t do any of the following to put a monster with the wrong Type/Attribute on your side of the field:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Normal Summon</li>
        <li>Tribute Summon</li>
        <li>Flip Summon</li>
        <li>Xyz Summon</li>
        <li>Synchro Summon</li>
        <li>Fusion Summon</li>
        <li>Special Summon with a monster&#39;s own effect.</li>
        <li>Activate a card or effect that would have to Special Summon a monster of the wrong Type/Attribute (including effects that could theoretically Summon anything, but currently cannot, such as &quot;Monster Reborn&quot; when you control Spellcasters but the only monsters in the Graveyard are Zombies).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While Rivalry/Gozen is active, you can still Set monsters of any Type/Attribute, and you can Special Summon monsters of the wrong Type/Attribute face-down. But you can&#39;t Flip Summon them afterwards, and they&#39;re sent to the Graveyard after damage calculation if your opponent attacks them. (Also, in that case, you won&#39;t get the effects of cards that need to be destroyed by battle and sent to the Graveyard, because they&#39;re sent to the Graveyard by the Trap Card&#39;s effect instead. But Flip Effects will still activate).</p>

      <ul>
        <li>You can activate cards and effects that would Summon the same Type/Attribute monster as you have on the field.</li>
        <li>
          You can also activate cards that would Summon more than one Type/Attribute of monster. The results depend on what you have on the field:
          <ul>
            <li>If you DON&#39;T control any monsters: You can activate cards that would Summon monsters with more than one Type/Attribute. All of them are Summoned, but you must immediately pick one Type/Attribute and send all others to the Graveyard.</li>
            <li>If you already DO control a monster: First of all, if the Summoning effect targets, you can only target monsters with the right Type/Attribute. If the Summoning effect does NOT target, you can activate it as long as it is possible to resolve the effect using only monsters with the right Type/Attribute. In this case, only the right monsters are Summoned to the field.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The same rule applies to the &quot;Gladiator Beast&quot; monsters and similar effects. You can return a Gladiator Beast to your Deck and activate its effect as long as there is another Gladiator Beast in your Deck that you COULD Summon that is the same Type/Attribute as the one you returned. However, if you have no face-up monsters when the effect resolves, you can Summon any Type/Attribute of monster.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Activated/Lingering effect modifier that increases/decreases the current ATK/DEF.</p>

      <p>Possible outcomes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>(x) are always applied successfully/Apply (x) after previous (5,6)</p>
        </li>

<h1 id="activation">Activation</h1>
<p>To activate is to use a card or effect in a way that makes a Chain Link.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Activating a card</strong>: when the card is placed face-up on the field</li>
  <li><strong>Activating an effect</strong>: when the effect of a card that is already face-up is activated</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="chains">Chains</h2>
<p>Chains are a way to order the resolution of multiple card effects. They are used when the effects of more than 1 card are activated at once, or when a player wants to use an effect after a card has been played, but BEFORE that card has an effect on the game.</p>
<p>If a card's effect is activated, the opponent is always given a chance to respond with a card effect of their own, creating a Chain. If your opponent responds with an effect, then you can choose to respond and add another effect to the Chain. If your opponent does not respond, you may activate a second effect and create a Chain to your own card's activation. Both players continue to add effects to the Chain until they both wish to add nothing else, then you resolve the outcome in reverse order - starting with the last card that was activated.</p>

</div>
As shown in the diagram, the first effect activated is Chain Link 1. The next effect is Chain Link 2, and so on. Every time a new Chain Link is made, they are stacked up in the order that the cards are activated. Once the Chain is completed, the outcome is resolved starting with the most recent card to be activated at the top of the Chain and proceeding down to Chain Link 1.

<h3 id="spell_speed">Spell Speed</h3>

Every type of card effect has a Spell Speed between 1 and 3. If you want to respond to a card effect in a Chain, you have to use an effect with Spell Speed 2 or higher, and it cannot have a lower Spell Speed than the effect you are responding to. Spell, Trap, and Effect Monster effects have different Spell Speeds. There are Spell Speeds from 1 to 3. You can only respond with an effect if it is Spell Speed 2 or higher, and has an equal or greater Spell Speed than the effect on the Chain Link before it.

        </ul>
        This is the slowest of all Spell Speeds. These cards cannot be activated in response to any other effects. Typically, these effects cannot be Chain Link 2 or higher, unless multiple Spell Speed 1 effects are activated simultaneously.

<h3 id="spell_speed">Actions which cannot be Chained to</h3>

You can only create a Chain by responding to the activation of a card or effect. Summoning a monster, Tributing, changing a monster's battle position and paying costs are not effect activations and therefore you cannot respond to those actions using a Chain.

<h2>Fast effect timing</h2>

Fast effects are card activations and effects with a Spell Speed of 2 or higher, including monster Quick Effects, Quick-Play Spell Cards, and Trap Cards (which includes both activating Trap Cards, and activating the effects of things like Continuous Trap Cards). Fast effects can be activated by either player - even during their opponent's turn, as long as the conditions are appropriate. When both players want to activate fast effects at the same time, they are placed on a Chain. Sometimes, it can make a big difference WHO places their fast effect on the Chain first: this can determine who "goes next". - Usually, the turn player has the chance to "go next" and activate the next fast effect. - However, during a Chain, the chance to go next passes back and forth between players. - Also, if the turn player doesn't wish to take any actions, and instead wants to move along in the turn (for example, to the next Step or Phase), the opponent has an opportunity to go next, and activate a fast effect, before the turn proceeds. Follow the
<a target="_blank" href="#fast_effect_timing_flowchart">chart</a> to see which player can "go next" regarding fast effects.

<h3 id="game_state_and_turn_player_actions">Game state and Turn Player Actions</h3>

Each Phase and Step starts with the turn player in box A of the chart listed below. This is when the game state is <strong>"open"</strong>, meaning the turn player has complete freedom of action. Many actions can ONLY be performed when the game state is open (when you're in box A). Examples: - Normal Summon (including Tribute Summon) - Set a card - Perform a Special Summon that does not start a Chain (including Xyz Summon, Synchro Summon) - Change a monster's Battle Position - Attempt to move to the next Phase/Step - Draw a card for your normal draw during the Draw Phase - Declare an attack - Activate an Ignition Effect - Activate a Spell Speed 1 Spell Card If the game state is "open", the turn player may perform any of the above actions that is appropriate. They can also choose to activate a fast effect, if they wish. Whenever either player performs an action, the game state is no longer open, but <strong>"closed"</strong>. If the game state is "closed", then only fast effects can be activated, dependent on Fast Effect Timing rules. When nothing is going on, and neither player wishes to do anything, the game state goes back to being "open". Technically, this means: - IF the Turn Player has the chance to activate the next fast effect - AND the turn player passes to the opponent - AND the opponent then passes back - AND no Chain is currently being formed then the game state is open again.

<h3 id="moving_next_phase">Moving to the Next Phase or Step</h3>

If the game state is open, and the turn player chooses not to do anything, and the opponent waives the chance to activate a fast effect, and both players agree to have the turn proceed, then you move to the next Phase or Step.

<h3 id="turn-player-s-priority">Turn Player's Priority</h3>
<p>The turn player always starts with Priority, or the choice to activate a card first, in each phase or step of their turn. As long as the turn player has Priority, the opponent cannot activate cards or effects, except for effects that activate automatically, like Trigger or Flip effects. The turn player can either:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use Priority to play a card or activate an effect</li>
  <li>Pass Priority to the opponent so they can activate an effect.</li>
</ul>
<p>A player must pass Priority to the opponent when moving on to the next phase or step. Strictly speaking, you would always declare that you're passing Priority before the end of every phase and step, and ask your opponent if they wish to play a card. However, for ease of play, announcing the end of your phases or steps implies giving up Priority. Therefore, when announcing the end of a phase, your opponent can just say "Before the end of your phase, I activate this card" and use a card.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The turn player starts with Priority to activate a card or effect first</li>
  <li>After a card's activation, and at the end of each phase or step, Priority passes to the opponent.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="simultaneous-effects">Simultaneous Effects</h3>
<h4 id="perform-actions-simultaneously">Perform actions simultaneously</h4>
<p>For cases like "Each player targets 1 monster," where both players resolve an effect simultaneously, the turn player resolves the effect first. In this example, after the turn player makes their selection, the other player makes theirs.</p>

<h4 id="simultaneous-effects-go-on-chain-segoc-">Simultaneous Effects Go On Chain (SEGOC)</h4>
<p>If effects of Spell Speed 1 cards (like Trigger Effects) are activated at the same time, they will be resolved in a special Chain. This Chain is made starting with the turn player's mandatory effects. If there is only 1 effect, that will be Chain Link 1.</p>
<p>If there are 2 or more effects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The turn player builds the Chain starting with their mandatory effects, in any order.</li>
  <li>Then the opponent continues the Chain with their mandatory effects in any order.</li>
  <li>Afterwards, the turn player adds their optional effects in any order.</li>
  <li>And finally the opponent adds their optional effects in any order.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="if-you-can-vs-when-you-can">If ... You Can vs When ... You Can</h3>
<p>There is a difference between optional effects that can be used "If" something happens and optional effects you can use "When" something happens.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Cards that say you can do something
    <strong>"When"</strong> something happens must activate their effects immediately when that something occurs. If they cannot, or something happens between the time the condition is met and the next time cards or effects can be activated, then you miss your chance to use them.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cards that say you can do something
    <strong>"If"</strong> something happens must activate their effects at the first possible opportunity to activate cards or effects after the "If" condition is met.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, this is only for <strong>optional effects</strong>. Effects that are mandatory, like "The White Stone of Legend", will always activate even though they say "When".</p>

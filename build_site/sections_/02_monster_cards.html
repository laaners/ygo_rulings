<h1>Monster cards</h1>
<div align="center">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/monster_card.png" width="400" />
</div>

<strong>1. Card Name</strong>
<p>This is the card's name. When a card name is mentioned in card text it appears in quotations. If cards have the same name, they are considered to be the same card.</p>

<strong>2. Level</strong>
<p>Count the number of stars here to find out the monster's Level. For Xyz Monsters, the number of stars is the Rank of the monster, and is on left.</p>

<strong>3. Attribute</strong>
<div align="center">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/attributes.png" width="180" />
</div>

<p>Every monster has an Attribute. This Attribute is sometimes important for card effects.</p>

<strong>4. Type</strong>
<p>Monsters are divided into various Types. Some monsters with specific abilities will have additional information here too, next to their Type.</p>

<strong>5. Card Number</strong>
<p>A card's identification number is found here. This number is useful for collecting, and for sorting your collection.</p>

<strong>6. ATK (Attack Points)/DEF (Defense Points)</strong>
<p>ATK is a monster's Attack Points and DEF is a monster's Defense Points. High Attack and Defense Points are good when battling!</p>

<strong>7. Card Description</strong>
<p>Card effects are written here, describing the monster's special abilities and how to use them. Normally, the effects of monsters cannot be used while they are Set face-down on the field. Yellow Normal Monster Cards do not have effects, and have a description of them written here that does not affect the game.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of Monster Cards. This game is more than a simple slugfest, so monsters with high Attack and Defense Points will not be enough. There are also monsters with strong special effects even though their ATK and DEF points are low. Therefore, your success in a Duel depends on how skillfully you can make use of the different kinds of cards.</p>

        An Effect Monster is a monster that has special abilities. The effects of these monsters are split into four categories:
        <ol>
          <li>Continuous Effect</li>
          <li>Ignition Effect</li>
          <li>Quick Effect</li>

        This effect is active while the Effect Monster Card is face-up on the field. The effect starts when the face-up monster appears on the field, and ends once that monster is gone or is no longer face-up; there is no trigger for its activation.
        <br />
        <b>Example</b>: "Monsters with 2000 or less ATK cannot declare an attack"

    <tr>
      <td><b>Ignition Effect</b></td>
      <td>
        You use this type of effect just by declaring its activation during your Main Phase. There are some Ignition Effects that have a cost to activate, like discarding cards from your hand, Tributing a monster, or paying LP.
        <br />
        <b>Example</b>: "You can Tribute this card, then target 1 monster on the field; destroy that target"

        Flip effect is a part of the Trigger Effect. This is an effect that is activated when a face-down card is flipped face-up. This can happen when it is Flip Summoned, attacked while face-down, or flipped face-up by a card effect. These effects start with the word "FLIP:" on the card.

<h3>Summoning the monster you tribute is not possible</h3>
<p>
  When activating a card (1) that has an effect that performs a Ritual Summon from the Graveyard for example, a valid Ritual Monster (2) must be present in the Graveyard. If you tribute a Ritual Monster (3) so that it meets the requirements to Summon (2) from the Graveyard, if (3) will be sent to the Graveyard as a result and (3) is also a valid target that can be Summoned with (1), you
  <strong>cannot</strong> Summon (3) from the Graveyard.

<h3>Special Summon to the Main Monster Zones</h3>
<div align="center">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/link_main_monster.png" width="250" />
</div>
Link and Pendulum Monsters Summoned from the Extra Deck normally have to go in the Extra Monster Zone. But Link Monsters open up more Zones for you to use, because every Main Monster Zone that a Link Monster points to can also be used to Summon Link and Pendulum monsters from your Extra Deck. Link and Pendulum Monsters that started in the Extra Deck, but later end up in the Graveyard (or are banished) and are Summoned from there, also go in the Main Monster Zones (and don't need a Link Monster to point to them).

<h3 id="vocabulary">Vocabulary</h3>

Some common terms to know when dealing with Link Monsters: -
<strong>Link Arrows</strong>: these are the big red triangles surrounding the picture of the monster. Only the red ones are Link Arrows. - <strong>Link Rating</strong>: the number in the lower right hand corner of a Link Monster where the DEF would normally be located. This is the number of Link Arrows the monster has, and also the number of Link Materials you need to use to Link Summon it. - <strong>Link Material</strong>: these are the face-up monsters on your side of the field that you use to Link Summon. - <strong>points to</strong>: the Monster Zones and/or monsters that are directly adjacent to the tip of a Link Arrow are the zones and/or monsters that Link Monster "points to". A Decode Talker placed in an Extra Monster Zone, for example, points to the Main Monster Zone directly above it, as well as the Main Monster Zones diagonally downwards to the left and right. A Decode Talker placed in the center Main Monster Zone does not point to anything, as there are no Monster Zones directly adjacent to the tip of its Link Arrows. - <strong>linked</strong>: a monster is "linked" if one or both of the following is true: 1. A Link Arrow is pointing to this monster. 2. This monster is a Link Monster and one of its Link Arrows is pointing to another monster. - <strong>co-linked</strong>: only Link Monsters can be "co-linked". Two Link Monsters are "co-linked" if they have Link Arrows that point at each other. In the following formation, Firewall Dragon is "co-linked" to 2 monsters: Link Spider and Honeybot.

<h3 id="extra-link">Extra Link</h3>
<p>In addition to being linked or co-linked, there's a special type of "linked" state that a monster can be in: "Extra Linked". Only Link Monsters can be Extra Linked, and this state only occurs when a series of co-linked Link Monsters is built that connects a Link Monster in an Extra Monster Zone to a Link Monster in the other Extra Monster Zone. Each monster in the series must be co-linked to each other monster it is linked to in the series.</p>
<p>In the example below, we've placed a series of co-linked monsters from the right-hand Extra Monster Zone over to the left-hand Extra Monster Zone where the opponent has Link Summoned "Decode Talker". Each of our Link Monsters is co-linked to each other Link Monster it's linked to in the series, so when we Link Summon the final monster in the series, each monster in the series becomes Extra Linked in addition to being co-linked and linked, including the opponent's "Decode Talker". Any Link Monster that is co-linked to one of the monsters in this series is also Extra Linked, even if it's not contributing towards making the monsters Extra Linked. For example, an extra "Honeybot" to the left or right of one of the "Firewall Dragons" would also be Extra Linked.</p>
<div align="center">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/extra_link.png" width="500" />
</div>

<p>Under normal circumstances you cannot occupy both Extra Monster Zones with monsters from your Extra Deck. There is one, and only one, exception to this rule: If Link Summoning to the second Extra Monster Zone would create a complete series of Extra Linked Link Monsters, you may Link Summon a monster to that Extra Monster Zone to complete that series. So in the example below, you are allowed to Link Summon a monster to the left-hand Extra Monster Zone if and only if that monster would be co-linked to the left-hand "Firewall Dragon", causing all of the monsters to become Extra Linked.</p>
<div align="center">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/extra_link_2.png" width="500" />
</div>

<p><strong>Link Monsters can be co-linked on diagonals</strong>, an Extra Link with only three monsters is then possible as well.</p>

<h3 id="link-monsters-as-link-material">Link Monsters as Link material</h3>
<p>Normally, 1 monster equals 1 Link Material. But when you use a Link Monster as material for another Link Summon, you can count it as either 1 monster, or as a number of monsters equal to its Link Rating. For example, if you want to Summon a Link 3 monster that requires 2 or more materials in its "recipe", you can either use 3 monsters (each counts as 1 material) or else a Link 2 Link Monster (counts as 1 or 2 materials) and a second monster (counts as 1 material).</p>

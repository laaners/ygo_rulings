<p><strong>1. Card Name</strong>\ Remember, cards with the same name are considered to be the same card, and you can only have up to 3 copies of the same card in your Main Deck and Side Deck combined.</p>
<p><strong>2. Type</strong>\ Instead of having an Attribute symbol like Monster Cards, a Spell Card has the "SPELL 魔" symbol and a Trap Card has the "TRAP 罠" symbol.</p>
<p><strong>3. Icon</strong></p>
<div align="center">
  <img loading="lazy" src="./images/spell_trap_icons.png" width="320">
</div>

<p>There are 6 types of icons that represent special properties a Spell or Trap Card may have. Spell and Trap Cards without an icon are called Normal Spell Cards or Normal Trap Cards.</p>
<p><strong>4. Card Description</strong>\ Each card's activation conditions and effects are provided here.</p>
<p><strong>5. Card Number</strong>\ A card's identification number is found here. This number is useful for collecting, and for sorting your collection.</p>
<p>Spell Cards can normally be activated only during your Main Phase, and help you out with different effects. Spell Cards have many powerful effects, like destroying other cards or strengthening monsters. Save these cards in your hand until you can get the best results out of them.</p>

<h2>Normal Spell Cards</h2>
<div>
  <img loading="lazy" align="left" src="./images/icon_normal.png" width="50">
  Normal Spell Cards have single-use effects. To use a Normal Spell Card, announce its activation to your opponent, placing it face-up on the field. If the activation succeeds, then you resolve the effect written on the card. After resolving the effect, send the card to the Graveyard.

<h2>Continuous Spell Cards</h2>

  These cards remain on the field once they are activated, and their effect continues while the card stays face-up on the field.

<h2>Equip Spell Cards</h2>
<div>
  <img loading="lazy" align="left" src="./images/icon_equip.png" width="50">
  These cards give an extra effect to 1 face-up monster of your choice (either your own or your opponent's, depending on the card). They remain on the field after they are activated. The Equip Spell Card affects only 1 monster (called the equipped monster), but still occupies one of your Spell &amp; Trap Zones. If the equipped monster is destroyed, flipped face-down, or removed from the field, its Equip Cards are destroyed.

<h2>Field Spell Cards</h2>
<div>
  <img loading="lazy" align="left" src="./images/icon_field.png" width="50">
  These cards go in your Field Zone and stay there. Each player can have 1 Field Spell Card on their own side of the field. To use another Field Spell, send your previous one to the Graveyard. These cards may be placed facedown in the Field Zone, but are not active until flipped face-up.

<h2>Quick-Play Spell Cards</h2>
<div>
  <img loading="lazy" align="left" src="./images/icon_quick.png" width="50">
  These are special Spell Cards that can be activated during any Phase of your turn, not just your Main Phase. You can also activate them during your opponent's turn if you Set the card face-down first, but then you cannot activate the card in the same turn you Set it.

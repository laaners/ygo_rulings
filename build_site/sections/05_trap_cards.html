<h1>Trap cards</h1>
      <p>Trap Cards will help you out with different effects, just like Spell Cards. The big difference between them is that you can activate Trap Cards during your opponent's turn. Before you can activate a Trap Card, you must Set it on the field first. You cannot activate a Trap in the same turn that you Set it, but you can activate it at any time after that-starting from the beginning of the next turn.</p>
      <p>Spell Cards can be Set face-down on the field like Trap Cards. However, the rules for the two types of cards are different. Spell Cards can be activated during the Main Phases even in the same turn that you Set them (except for Quick-Play Spell Cards). Setting them does not allow you to use them on your opponent's turn; they still can only be activated during your Main Phase. You can Set a Spell Card face-down on the field to bluff your opponent into thinking you have a powerful Trap.</p>

        These are special Spell Cards that can be activated during any Phase of your turn, not just your Main Phase. You can also activate them during your opponent's turn if you Set the card face-down first, but then you cannot activate the card in the same turn you Set it.

      <h2>Continuous Trap Cards</h2>
      <div>
        <img loading="lazy" align="left" src="./images/icon_continuous.png" width="50">
        Just like Continuous Spell Cards, Continuous Trap Cards remain on the field once they are activated and their effects continue while they are face-up on the field. Some Continuous Trap Cards have abilities similar to the Ignition Effects or Trigger Effects that can be found on Effect Monster Cards.

      <h2>Counter Trap Cards</h2>

        <img loading="lazy" align="left" src="./images/icon_counter.png" width="50">
        These Trap Cards are normally activated in response to the activation of other cards, and may have abilities like negating the effects of those cards. These types of Traps are effective against Normal Spell Cards or Normal Trap Cards, which are otherwise hard to stop, however many Counter Trap Cards require a cost to activate them.

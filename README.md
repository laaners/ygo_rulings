# Getting started
## Things you need to duel

- **Main Deck**
	- The (Main) Deck must be 40 to 60 cards
	- You can only have up to 3 copies of the same card in your Deck, Extra Deck and Side Deck combined.

- **Extra Deck**\
This Deck consists of Xyz Monsters, Synchro Monsters, Fusion Monsters and Link Monster which can be used during the game if you meet certain requirements
	- You can have up to 15 cards in the Extra Deck
	- The Extra Deck can contain Xyz Monsters, Synchro Monsters, Fusion Monsters and Link Monsters in any combination
	- These cards are not counted towards the 40-card minimum limit your Main Deck.

- **Side Deck**\
This is a separate Deck of cards you can use to change your Deck during a Match. After each Duel in a Match, you can swap any card from your Side Deck with a card from your Deck and/or Extra Deck to customize your strategy against your opponent
	- The number of cards in your Side Decks must not exceed 15
	- The number of cards in your Side Deck before and after you swap any cards must be exactly the same

## The Game Mat/Field
The Game Mat helps you organize your cards during a Duel. When you use your cards you place them on the Game Mat. Different kinds of cards are placed in different Zones.

<div align="center">
	<img src="./images/game_mat.png" width=800 />
</div>

**1. Main Monster Zone**\
This is where you put your monsters when they're played. You can have up to 5 cards here. There are 3 ways to position your Monster Cards: face-up Attack Position, face-up Defense Position, and face-down Defense Position. Place the card upright for Attack Position, and sideways for Defense Position.

**2. Spell & Trap Zone Pendulum Zone**\
This is where you put Spell & Trap Cards. You can have up to 5 cards here. You place them here face-up to activate them, or place them face-down. Pendulum Monster Cards can be activated in the leftmost and rightmost zones as Spells. This causes the zone you use to also become a Pendulum Zone for as long as the Pendulum Monster Card is there.

**3. Graveyard (GY)**\
When Monster Cards are destroyed, and when Spell & Trap Cards are used, they're sent face-up to this space. The contents of both players' Graveyards are public knowledge, and your opponent can look through yours at any time during the Duel. The order of the cards in the Graveyard should not be changed. Graveyard is shortened in the card text to "GY".

**4. Deck**\
Your Deck is placed face-down in this space. You draw cards from here to add to your hand. If a card effect requires you to reveal cards from your Deck, or look through it, shuffle it and put it back in this space afterwards.

**5. Field Zone**\
Special Spell Cards called Field Spell Cards are played here. Each player can have 1 Field Spell Card on their own side of the field. To use another Field Spell, send your previous one to the Graveyard. Field Spell Cards do not count towards the 5-card limit of your Spell & Trap Zone.

**6. Extra Deck**\
Place your Extra Deck face-down in this space. You can look at the cards in your own Extra Deck during the game. During a Duel, Extra Deck Monsters may be Summoned to the field from here using special methods. Pendulum Monster Cards that would be sent from the field to the Graveyard are placed face-up here.

 **7. Extra Monster Zone**\
This is where you put your monsters that are Summoned to the field by special methods from the Extra Deck

- Normally, each player can only use 1 of these zones. A monster placed in this zone does not count towards the 5-monster limit of your Main Monster 
Zone.

- Fusion, Synchro, and Xyz Monsters can be first Summoned from the Extra Deck to any of your Main Monster Zones. They do not have to be Summoned to the Extra Monster Zone or a spot that a Link Monster is pointing to. You can still Summon a Fusion/Synchro/Xyz Monster from the Extra Deck to your Extra Monster Zone if you want to, though.

- The restrictions requiring an Extra Monster Zone or Link Monster pointing still apply to Link Monsters and Pendulum Monsters that are Summoned from the Extra Deck.

# Game elements: cards
## Monster cards

<div align="center">
	<img src="./images/monster_card.png" width=400 />
</div>

**1. Card Name**\
This is the card's name. When a card name is mentioned in card text it appears in quotations. If cards have the same name, they are considered to be the same card.

**2. Level**\
Count the number of stars here to find out the monster's Level. For Xyz Monsters, the number of stars is the Rank of the monster, and is on left.

**3. Attribute**
<div align="center">
	<img src="./images/attributes.png" width=180 />
</div>

Every monster has an Attribute. This Attribute is sometimes important for card effects.

**4. Type**\
Monsters are divided into various Types. Some monsters with specific abilities will have additional information here too, next to their Type.

**5. Card Number**\
A card's identification number is found here. This number is useful for collecting, and for sorting your collection.

**6. ATK (Attack Points)/DEF (Defense Points)**\
ATK is a monster's Attack Points and DEF is a monster's Defense Points. High Attack and Defense Points are good when battling!

**7. Card Description**\
Card effects are written here, describing the monster's special abilities and how to use them. Normally, the effects of monsters cannot be used while they are Set face-down on the field. Yellow Normal Monster Cards do not have effects, and have a description of them written here that does not affect the game.

There are many kinds of Monster Cards. This game is more than a simple slugfest, so monsters with high Attack and Defense Points will not be enough. There are also monsters with strong special effects even though their ATK and DEF points are low. Therefore, your success in a Duel depends on how skillfully you can make use of the different kinds of cards.

<table align="center">
	<tr>
		<td align="center" width=150>
			<img src="./images/card_dark_magician_girl.png" />
		</td>
		<td>
			An Effect Monster is a monster that has special abilities. The effects of these monsters are split into four categories:
			<ol>
				<li>Continuous Effect</li>
				<li>Ignition Effect</li>
				<li>Quick Effect</li>
				<li>Trigger Effect (including Flip)</li>
			</ol>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Continuous Effect</th>
		<td>
			This effect is active while the Effect Monster Card is face-up on the field. The effect starts when the face-up monster appears on the field, and ends once that monster is gone or is no longer face-up; there is no trigger for its activation.
			<br>
			<b>Example</b>: "Monsters with 2000 or less ATK cannot declare an attack"
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Ignition Effect</th>
		<td>
			You use this type of effect just by declaring its activation during your Main Phase. There are some Ignition Effects that have a cost to activate, like discarding cards from your hand, Tributing a monster, or paying LP.
			<br>
			<b>Example</b>: "You can Tribute this card, then target 1 monster on the field; destroy that target"
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Quick Effect</th>
		<td>
			These are special monster effects that you can activate even during your opponent's turn. These types of effects have a Spell Speed of 2, even though all other monster effects have a Spell Speed of 1.
			<br>
			<b>Example</b>: "When an effect is activated (Quick Effect): You can target 1 monster in your GY; Special Summon it."
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Trigger Effect</th>
		<td>
			These effects are activated at specific times, such as "during the Standby Phase" or "when this monster is destroyed".
			<br>
			<b>Example</b>: "When this card is destroyed by battle and sent to the GY: Target 1 card on the field; destroy that target."
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Flip Effect</th>
		<td>
			Flip effect is a part of the Trigger Effect. This is an effect that is activated when a face-down card is flipped face-up. This can happen when it is Flip Summoned, attacked while face-down, or flipped face-up by a card effect. These effects start with the word "FLIP:" on the card.
			<br>
			<b>Example</b>: "FLIP: Draw 1 card."

#### Xyz Materials

Monsters that are used to Xyz Summon are called "Xyz Materials", and are placed underneath the Xyz Monster, to show that they are attached to it. 

- Monsters that have become Xyz Materials are not treated as cards on the field.

- When an Xyz Monster leaves the field, all of the Xyz Materials attached to it are sent to the Graveyard.

- If an Xyz Monster is flipped face-down, or becomes controlled by the opponent, the Xyz Materials are not sent to the Graveyard. They remain attached to the Xyz Monster.

#### Special Summon to the Main Monster Zones
<div align="center">
	<img src="./images/link_main_monster.png" width=250 />
</div>
Link and Pendulum Monsters Summoned from the Extra Deck normally have to go in the Extra Monster Zone. But Link Monsters open up more zones for you to use, because every Main Monster Zone that a Link Monster points to can also be used to Summon Link and Pendulum monsters from your Extra Deck.

Link and Pendulum Monsters that started in the Extra Deck, but later end up in the Graveyard (or are banished) and are Summoned from there, also go in the Main Monster Zones (and don't need a Link Monster to point to them).

#### Link Monsters as Link material
Normally, 1 monster equals 1 Link Material. But when you use a Link Monster as material for another Link Summon, you can count it as either 1 monster, or as a number of monsters equal to its Link Rating. For example, if you want to Summon a Link 3 monster that requires 2 or more materials in its "recipe", you can either use 3 monsters (each counts as 1 material) or else a Link 2 Link Monster (counts as 1 or 2 materials) and a second monster (counts as 1 material).

#### Defense
Link Monsters have no DEF and cannot ever be in Defense Position. They can't be changed to Defense Position by a card effect. They can't even be flipped into face-down Defense Position.

</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### Change control
If you take control of your opponent's monster in the Extra Monster Zone, it moves to your Main Monster Zone. When it goes back to your opponent, it goes to their Main Monster Zone, not the Extra Monster Zone.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### Non-monster card as material
As long as the materials meet the requirements of the Link Monster you want to Summon, you can use a Token or Trap Card that is treated as a monster as the Link Material.

## Summoning Monster cards

There are several ways to play monsters onto the field. These ways can be categorized into 2 groups: actions that can be done only once per turn, and actions that can be done multiple times per turn:
1. **You can do one of these once per turn**:
   - Normal Summon
   - Normal Set
   - Tribute Summon
2. **You can do as many of these during a turn as you want**:
   - Flip Summon
   - Special Summon
   - Special Summon with a Card's Effect

<p align="left">
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/">Official rulebook page 24</a>
</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Normal Summon
This is the most common way to Summon a monster. Simply play a Monster Card from your hand onto the field in face-up Attack Position. All Normal Monsters, and most Effect Monsters (unless they have a specific restriction), can be Summoned in this way.

<p align="left">
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/">Official rulebook page 24</a>
</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Normal Set
To play a Monster Card from your hand in face-down Defense Position is called a Normal Set.
- A monster Normal Set on the field is NOT considered Summoned.
- It has been Normal Set, and can be Summoned with a Flip Summon or flipped face-up by an attack or card effect.
- Remember, you can only Normal Summon OR Normal Set (Normal Summon/Set, in short), once per turn, so if you Normal Set a monster you cannot also Normal Summon a monster that turn.
- You cannot play a monster from your hand onto the field in face-up Defense Position

<p align="left">
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/">Official rulebook page 24</a>
</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Tribute Summon
For monsters that are Level 5 or higher, you must Tribute at least 1 monster you control before the Normal Summon/Set. This is called a Tribute Summon. Monsters that are Level 5 or 6 require 1 Tribute and Monsters that are Level 7 or higher require 2 Tributes
<div align="center">

| Level 5, 6 | Level 7 or higher |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| 1 Tribute  | 2 Tributes        |

</div>

- If you Tribute Summon in face-down Defense Position, it is called a Tribute Set. A monster Tribute Set on the field is NOT considered Summoned.
- When a card explains a special method to Tribute Summon a monster, you can also Tribute Set the monster by the same method
<p align="left">
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/">Official rulebook page 24</a>
</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Flip Summon

You can change a face-down Defense Position monster into face-up Attack Position, without using a card effect. This is called a Flip Summon.
- When you Flip Summon, you cannot change the monster to face-up Defense Position, only to face-up Attack Position.
- A Monster Card cannot be Flip Summoned in the same turn that it was Set onto the field.
- You cannot use most monsters' effects until they are face-up
<p align="left">
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/">Official rulebook page 25</a>
</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Special Summon

Some monsters can be played onto the field without being Normal Summoned or Set. This is called a Special Summon. Link Summons, Pendulum Summons, Xyz Summons, Synchro Summons, Fusion Summons and Ritual Summons are all Special Summons. Some Effect Monsters also have specific conditions that allow you to Special Summon them. Unless otherwise specified, a Special Summoned monster is played onto the field in your choice of face-up Attack Position or face-up Defense Position.
<p align="left">
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/">Official rulebook page 25</a>
</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Special Summon with a Card's Effect

Monsters can also be Special Summoned onto the field through the effect of another card.
<p align="left">
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/">Official rulebook page 25</a>
</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### Properly Special Summon
This is different from "Special Summon Monsters." You cannot use a card effect to Special Summon those monsters from your hand, Deck, or the Graveyard unless it was properly Special Summoned first. For example, if a Synchro Monster is sent from your Extra Deck to the Graveyard without being Synchro Summoned, you cannot use a Spell Card to Special Summon it from the Graveyard, because Synchro Monsters have to be properly Special Summoned first, before they can be Special Summoned by another card's effect.

<p align="left">

</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### Summon restrictions and successful Summons

The restriction of "you cannot Normal or Special Summon the turn you activate this card" only refers to monsters that were successfully Summoned. Same for "you can only Special Summon X once per turn" restrictions.

## Spell cards

<div align="center">
	<img src="./images/spell_trap_card.png" width=400 />
</div>

**1. Card Name**\
Remember, cards with the same name are considered to be the same card, and you can only have up to 3 copies of the same card in your Main Deck and Side Deck combined.

**2. Type**\
Instead of having an Attribute symbol like Monster Cards, a Spell Card has the "SPELL 魔" symbol and a Trap Card has the "TRAP 罠" symbol.

**3. Icon**
<div align="center">
	<img src="./images/spell_trap_icons.png" width=320 />
</div>

There are 6 types of icons that represent special properties a Spell or Trap Card may have. Spell and Trap Cards without an icon are called Normal Spell Cards or Normal Trap Cards.

**4. Card Description**\
Each card's activation conditions and effects are provided here.

**5. Card Number**\
A card's identification number is found here. This number is useful for collecting, and for sorting your collection.

Spell Cards can normally be activated only during your Main Phase, and help you out with different effects. Spell Cards have many powerful effects, like destroying other cards or strengthening monsters. Save these cards in your hand until you can get the best results out of them.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Normal Spell Cards

<div>
	<img align="left" src="./images/icon_normal.png" width=50>
	Normal Spell Cards have single-use effects. To use a Normal Spell Card, announce its activation to your opponent, placing it face-up on the field. If the activation succeeds, then you resolve the effect written on the card. After resolving the effect, send the card to the Graveyard.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Ritual Spell Cards

<div>
	<img align="left" src="./images/icon_ritual.png" width=50>
	These Spell Cards are used to perform Ritual Summons. Use these cards in the same way as you would use Normal Spell Cards.
	<br clear="left">

</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Continuous Spell Cards

<div>
	<img align="left" src="./images/icon_continuous.png" width=50>
	These cards remain on the field once they are activated, and their effect continues while the card stays face-up on the field.
	<br clear="left">

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Equip Spell Cards

<div>
	<img align="left" src="./images/icon_equip.png" width=50>
	These cards give an extra effect to 1 face-up monster of your choice (either your own or your opponent's, depending on the card). They remain on the field after they are activated. The Equip Spell Card affects only 1 monster (called the equipped monster), but still occupies one of your Spell & Trap Zones. If the equipped monster is destroyed, flipped face-down, or removed from the field, its Equip Cards are destroyed.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Field Spell Cards

<div>
	<img align="left" src="./images/icon_field.png" width=50>
	These cards go in your Field Zone and stay there. Each player can have 1 Field Spell Card on their own side of the field. To use another Field Spell, send your previous one to the Graveyard. These cards may be placed facedown in the Field Zone, but are not active until flipped face-up.
	<br clear="left">

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Quick-Play Spell Cards

<div>
	<img align="left" src="./images/icon_quick.png" width=50>
	These are special Spell Cards that can be activated during any Phase of your turn, not just your Main Phase. You can also activate them during your opponent's turn if you Set the card face-down first, but then you cannot activate the card in the same turn you Set it.
	<br clear="left">
</div>

</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Trap cards

Trap Cards will help you out with different effects, just like Spell Cards. The big difference between them is that you can activate Trap Cards during your opponent's turn. Before you can activate a Trap Card, you must Set it on the field first. You cannot activate a Trap in the same turn that you Set it, but you can activate it at any time after that-starting from the beginning of the next turn.

Spell Cards can be Set face-down on the field like Trap Cards. However, the rules for the two types of cards are different. Spell Cards can be activated during the Main Phases even in the same turn that you Set them (except for Quick-Play Spell Cards). Setting them does not allow you to use them on your opponent's turn; they still can only be activated during your Main Phase. You can Set a Spell Card face-down on the field to bluff your opponent into thinking you have a powerful Trap.

</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Normal Trap Cards

<div>
	<img align="left" src="./images/icon_normal.png" width=50>
	These are special Spell Cards that can be activated during any Phase of your turn, not just your Main Phase. You can also activate them during your opponent's turn if you Set the card face-down first, but then you cannot activate the card in the same turn you Set it.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Continuous Trap Cards

<div>
	<img align="left" src="./images/icon_continuous.png" width=50>
	Just like Continuous Spell Cards, Continuous Trap Cards remain on the field once they are activated and their effects continue while they are face-up on the field. Some Continuous Trap Cards have abilities similar to the Ignition Effects or Trigger Effects that can be found on Effect Monster Cards.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Counter Trap Cards

<div>
	<img align="left" src="./images/icon_counter.png" width=50>
	These Trap Cards are normally activated in response to the activation of other cards, and may have abilities like negating the effects of those cards. These types of Traps are effective against Normal Spell Cards or Normal Trap Cards, which are otherwise hard to stop, however many Counter Trap Cards require a cost to activate them.

# Game elements: other

## Monster Tokens

Monster Tokens are monsters that appear on the field as the result of a card's effect.

- They are not included in the Deck, and cannot be sent anywhere other than the field, such as the hand or Graveyard.

- When a Token is destroyed or returned to the hand or Deck, they are simply removed from the field instead.
  
- Each Monster Token takes up 1 of your 5 Monster Zones.

- Their battle position is always either face-up Attack Position or faceup Defense Position.

- Tokens cannot be used as an Xyz Material.

- Tokens on the field are treated as Normal Monsters. 

<p align="left">
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/">Official rulebook page 49</a>
</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Banishing a token is a conjunction success

If a Token's (1) propertis (Attribute, Type, ATK, DEF, Level...) satisfy a certain card's (2) activation requirement and (2) requires to banish a Monster with those properties, (2) can be activated. If (1) is banished because of (2)'s cost, (2) resolves normally even if (1) original properties were not originally the one necessary to fulfil the activation of (2).

- [Example: "DNA Surgery", "Dragon's Rebirth"](https://db.ygoresources.com/qa#275)

</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Counters

You may need to place these on cards for some card effects.

- You cannot place counters unless a card effect allows it.

- Cards may have effects that change with the number of counters on them, or require you to remove counters as a cost.

- Some counters have specific names, such as "Spell Counter" or "Clock Counter." Other than their names, each individual counter itself does not have any effects.

# General Game Mechanics

## Forbidden & Limited Cards

[Official TCG F&L list](www.yugioh-card.com/en/limited/)

Normally, your Deck (including Extra Deck and Side Deck) can contain up to 3 copies of a card that has the same name. However, certain cards have specific quantity restrictions that further limit the number that can be included in a Deck. There are 3 types of restrictions:

- Limited cards are restricted to 1 copy in a Deck

- Semi-Limited cards are restricted to 2 copies in a Deck

- Forbidden cards are not allowed to be included at all

The list of Forbidden and Limited cards is updated regularly and is posted on the Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG Official Website. This list is applied to official tournaments so please check it before participating. Official Website: www.yugioh-card.com

</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Public Knowledge

The number of cards in a player's hand and Decks, the cards in their Graveyards, and each player's current LP are all public knowledge and both players can verify these things at any time. **If asked, you must answer these things to your opponent truthfully**.

- You are allowed to pick up and verify the cards in your opponent's Graveyard but you must ask their permission first.
- You may not change the order of the cards when verifying their Graveyard.

</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Rules vs. Card Effects

If there is a discrepancy between the basic rules and a card's effect, the card effect takes precedence. For example, a monster can only attack once per turn, but with a card effect, it is possible to attack twice.

# Duel and Turn Structure

A single game is called a Duel, and a Duel ends when one player wins or the game ends in a draw. Duels are played in sets of 3 called a Match, and the winner of best 2-out-of-3 wins the Match.

## Winning a Duel
Each player starts a Duel with 8000 LP (Life Points). You win a Duel if:
- You reduce your opponent's LP to 0
- If your opponent is unable to draw a card
- If a card's special effect says you win

If you and your opponent both reach 0 LP at the same time, the Duel is declared a draw.

A Duel progresses in a series of turns which are divided into phases

</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Victory conditions and immediately-afters

Alternate victory conditions are checked and met before a new chain starts, even if a mandatory trigger effect has to start a chain.

- [Example: "Exodia the Forbidden One", "Graceful Charity", "Magical Thorn"](https://db.ygoresources.com/qa#233)

<p align="left">

</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Draw Phase

This is the first phase. The player whose turn it is (the "turn player")
- **Must draw 1 card** from the top of their Deck (**except for the very
1st turn of the Duel**). A player with no cards left in their Deck and unable to draw loses the Duel.
- **Can**, after the draw, **activate Trap Cards or Quick-Play Spell Cards** before proceeding to the Standby Phase.

**IMPORTANT**: The player who goes first cannot draw during the Draw Phase of their first turn.

<p align="left">

</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Standby Phase

Some cards have effects that activate, or costs you must pay, in the Standby Phase. The turn player:
- **Can activate Trap Cards or Quick-Play Spell Cards** before proceeding to the Main Phase 1.

<p align="left">
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/">Official rulebook page 35</a>
</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Main Phase 1

This is when you play most of your cards: you can Normal Summon, Set, or change the battle position of a monster, activate a card's effect, and Set Spell and Trap Cards. These actions can be done in any order you want, but some actions have restrictions. The turn player:
- **Can Summon or Set a monster**. There is no limit to the number of times you can Flip Summon or Special Summon during a turn, but you can only Normal Summon or Set a monster (including a Tribute Summon) once per turn.
- **Can change their Monster's Battle Position**. This includes Flip Summoning a monster, or changing the position of a face-up monster to face-up Attack or Defense Position. You can change the position of each monster you control, except in three cases:
  1. You cannot change the battle position of a monster that was played onto the field this turn.
  2. You cannot change it in Main Phase 2 if the monster attacked during the Battle Phase.
  3. You cannot change it if you have already changed its battle position once this turn.
- **Can Activate a Card or Effect**. You can activate Spell and Trap Cards, or the effects of Spell, Trap, or Effect Monster Cards as many times as you want during this phase, as long as you can keep paying any costs involved. 
- **Can Set Spell and Trap Cards**. You can Set Spell and Trap Cards face-down in your Spell & Trap Zone during this phase, as long as you have space.

<p align="left">

</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Battle Phase

Now it's time to battle with your Monster Cards! This phase is divided into steps. You do not have to conduct a Battle Phase every turn, even if you have a monster on the field.

**IMPORTANT**: The player who goes first cannot conduct their Battle Phase on their first turn.

<div align="center">
	<img src="./images/bp_steps.png" width=300 />
</div>

The Battle Phase is split into 4 steps and is conducted in the
order shown in the diagram. The Battle Step and Damage Step are repeated each time you attack with a monster.

<p align="left">
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/">Official rulebook page 37</a>
</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Start Step

This step starts the Battle Phase. The turn player should announce "I'm entering the Battle Phase." Remember, the player who goes first cannot conduct a Battle Phase in their very first turn.

<p align="left">
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/">Official rulebook page 38</a>
</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Battle Step

Select 1 monster on your side of the field to attack with, and 1 of your opponent's monsters as your attack target, and then declare the attack. If your opponent does not have any monsters on the field, you can attack directly. Play then proceeds to the Damage Step. Afterwards, the attacking player returns to the Battle Step, and repeats this procedure.
- Each face-up Attack Position monster you control is allowed 1 attack per turn.
- You do not have to attack with a monster if you don't want to.

<p align="left">
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/">Official rulebook page 38</a>
</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### Replay Rules during the Battle Step

<div>
	<img align="left" src="./images/batte_step_replay.png" width=180>
	After you've announced your attacking monster and the attack target monster during a Battle Step, the attack target might be removed from the field, or a new monster may be played onto the opponent's side of the field before the Damage Step, due to a card's effect. This causes a "Replay." When this occurs, you can choose to attack with the same monster again, or choose to attack with a different monster, or choose not to attack at all.
	<br>
	Note that if you attack with a different monster, the first monster is still considered to have declared an attack, and it cannot attack again this turn.
	<br clear="left">
</div>

<p align="left">

</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Damage Step

In this step, the players calculate the result of the battle and whatever damage is done. After finishing the Damage Step, return to the Battle Step.

<p align="left">
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/">Official rulebook page 38</a>
</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### Determining Damage

You calculate battle damage based on the battle position of the monster you are attacking. If you attack an Attack Position monster, compare ATK vs. ATK. If you attack a Defense Position monster, compare your monster's ATK vs. the attacked monster's DEF.

<table align="center">
	<tr>
		<th colspan=2>
			<br/>
			ATK. of the attacking Monster VS. ATK of Opponent's Monster
			<br/>			
			<br/>			
		</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>WIN</th>
		<td>
			When your attacking monster's ATK is higher than the ATK of the opponent's monster, the attacking monster destroys the opponent's monster and sends it to the Graveyard. The amount that your attacking monster's ATK exceeds the ATK of your opponent's monster is subtracted from your opponent's LP as battle damage.
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>TIE</th>
		<td>

#### Sub-steps of the Damage Step
There are five distinct timings within the Damage Step.
1. Start of the Damage Step

2. Before damage calculation

3. Damage calculation

4. After damage calculation

5. End of the Damage Step

#### Cards/effects that can be activated during the Damage Step

✔️ Counter Trap Cards

✔️ Mandatory effects

✔️ Fast effects that negate the **activation** of a card(s), or negate the **activation** of an effect(s)

✔️ Spell/Trap Cards and Quick/Quick-like Effects that directly alter the ATK/DEF of a monster(s), but **only up until damage calculation**. During damage calculation or afterwards in the Damage Step, they cannot be activated
	
$\hspace{2em}$✔️ These cards and effects do not have to affect a battling monster; they can be used during the Damage Step to affect the ATK/DEF of a monster(s) that is not currently battling

$\hspace{2em}$❌ Optional Spell/Trap Cards and Quick/Quick-like Effects that can **indirectly** change the ATK/DEF of a monster (such as "Reverse Trap" or "Skill Drain") **cannot** be activated during the Damage Step for that reason alone

$\hspace{2em}$✔️ Trap Cards that equip themselves to monsters and have Continuous-like Effects that **directly** alter the ATK/DEF of the equipped monster, such as "Horn of the Phantom Beast", **can** be activated during the Damage Step for that reason alone

$\hspace{2em}$❌ Cards like "Half or Nothing", which **might not** alter ATK/DEF at resolution, **cannot** be activated during the Damage Step for that reason alone

$\hspace{2em}$❌ Cards such as "Powerful Rebirth" and "Reverse of Neos", which Special Summon a monster and exclusively **modify the ATK/DEF of that Summoned** monster, **cannot** be activated during the Damage Step for that reason alone

$\hspace{2em}$✔️ If a Set Continuous Trap Card has an **optional Quick-like Effect that directly** alters the ATK/DEF of a monster(s) (such as "Attack of the Cornered Rat"), that Trap Card **can** be activated during the Damage Step until damage calculation, but only if that Quick-like Effect is activated and resolved in the same Chain Link as the activation of the Trap Card itself

$\hspace{2em}$✔️ Continuous Trap Cards with **Continuous-like Effects that directly** alter the ATK/DEF of a monster(s), such as "Fire Formation - Kaiyo", **can** be activated during the Damage Step until damage calculation

$\hspace{4em}$✔️ Such Trap Cards can be activated even if their relevant Continuous-like Effect would not affect any monsters, such as activating "Dark Contract with the Witch" during your own turn or while you control no Fiend-Type monsters, or activating "Unpossessed" when a monster other than a "Familiar-Possessed" monster is attacking

$\hspace{4em}$✔️ Such Trap Cards can be activated even if their relevant Continuous-like Effect only applies an ATK/DEF change under particular conditions and those conditions are not currently met (such as activating "Chosen of Zefra" while there are fewer than 3 "Zefra" monsters face-up in your Extra Deck), unless that condition could never be met during the Damage Step (such as "Swift Samurai Storm!")

$\hspace{4em}$❌ Even if a Continuous Trap Card can be activated during the Damage Step due to having a Continuous-like Effect that alters ATK/DEF, if it also has a Quick-like Effect that can be activated in the same Chain Link as the activation of the Trap Card itself (such as "Dark Contract with the Witch"), that Quick-like Effect cannot be activated at the same time as the Trap Card's activation during the Damage Step, unless it has another valid reason allowing it to be activated during the Damage Step

$\hspace{2em}$❌ Unique exceptions are "Evil Blast", "Scrap Sheen" (TCG only), "Zero Force", "Curse of Anubis", and the Quick-like Effect of "Rocket Hand", which have rulings stating that they cannot be activated during the Damage Step.

$\hspace{2em}$❌ Unlike Quick/Quick-like Effects, having the effect of directly altering the ATK/DEF of a monster(s) **does not permit optional Trigger/Trigger-like Effects to be activated during the Damage Step**, with examples being "Morpho Butterspy" and "Performapal Turn Toad"

✔️ Optional Trigger and Trigger-like Effects (if that effect activates in response to the card itself being moved to a different location including leaving the field, being flipped face-up including Flip effects, or having its battle position changed) can be activated during the Damage Step, unless the effect performs a Normal or Fusion Summon

$\hspace{2em}$❌ In general, other optional Trigger and Trigger-like Effects that have **activation conditions that can be met both during and outside the Damage Step cannot be activated**. For cards that have Problem-Solving Card Text, these normally state "(except during the Damage Step)" in their activation conditions. Otherwise, these effects are associated with activation conditions that involve actions regarding other cards, such as "When/If a ... is destroyed", "When/If a ... is added from ... to your hand", "When/If a ... monster is Special Summoned", etc. of cards like "Revival Rose", "Ambulanceroid", and "Cyber Dinosaur". This includes Trigger Effects of monsters that can activate in response to actions involving itself and/or other cards (but not just itself or other cards), such as "Madolche Chickolates"; they cannot be activated during the Damage Step.

✔️ Any effect that specifically mentions an activation timing that is unique to the Damage Step

$\hspace{2em}$✔️ This is indicated by phrases in the text such as "During damage calculation", "At the end of the Damage Step", "If/When you take battle damage", etc.

$\hspace{2em}$✔️ This includes cards and effects that activate in response to damage (without specifying battle damage). If a Set Continuous Trap Card has an optional Trigger-like or optional Quick-like Effect with an activation timing at least partially specific to the Damage Step (such as "Yang Zing Creation" and "Damage = Reptile"), that Trap Card can be activated during the Damage Step if that Trigger-like/Quick-like Effect is also activated in the same Chain Link as the activation of the Trap Card itself

A card only needs to meet one of the above requirements to be activated during the Damage Step. As long as it does not explicitly specify (except during the Damage Step), even if it fails to satisfy one of the above requirements, if it satisfies another one it can be activated during the Damage Step. For example, "Rope of Life" Special Summons a monster and exclusively changes the ATK of the Summoned monster (like "Reverse of Neos"); cards with such effects cannot be activated during the Damage Step for that reason alone, but since "Rope of Life" also has an activation timing that is unique to the Damage Step ("When a monster(s) is destroyed by battle and sent to your Graveyard:"), it can be activated during the Damage Step.

</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### End of the Damage Step still occurs even if damage calculation was never conducted

A card whose effect reads "at the end of the Damage Step" can be activated even if damage calculation has not been conducted and Before Damage Calculation has been reached.

- [Example: "Number C5: Chaos Chimera Dragon", "Reflect Bounder", "Divine Wrath"](https://db.ygoresources.com/qa#6177)

### End Step

After you've resolved all your battles by repeating the Battle and Damage Steps, and you have no more monsters you want to attack with, announce to your opponent that you are ending your Battle Phase.

<p align="left">
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/">Official rulebook page 38</a>
</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Main Phase 2

**If you conducted your Battle Phase**, your turn moves to Main Phase 2 afterwards. The actions a player can perform in this phase are the same as in Main Phase 1. However, if the player already did something in Main Phase 1 that has a limit to the number of times it can be done, the player cannot do it again in Main Phase 2.

</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## End Phase

Announce the end of your turn, and if there are any cards on the field which say "...during the End Phase..." in their text, resolve those effects in this phase. If you have more than 6 cards in your hand at the end of this phase, select and discard cards to the Graveyard until you only have 6 cards in your hand.

# Activation

## Chains

Chains are a way to order the resolution of multiple card effects. They are used when the effects of more than 1 card are activated at once, or when a player wants to use an effect after a card has been played, but BEFORE that card has an effect on the game.

If a card's effect is activated, the opponent is always given a chance to respond with a card effect of their own, creating a Chain. If your opponent responds with an effect, then you can choose to respond and add another effect to the Chain. If your opponent does not respond, you may activate a second effect and create a Chain to your own card's activation. Both players continue to add effects to the Chain until they both wish to add nothing else, then you resolve the outcome in reverse order - starting with the last card that was activated.
<div align="center">
	<img src="./images/chain_diagram.png" width=250>
</div>
As shown in the diagram, the first effect activated is Chain Link 1. The next effect is Chain Link 2, and so on. Every time a new Chain Link is made, they are stacked up in the order that the cards are activated. Once the Chain is completed, the outcome is resolved starting with the most recent card to be activated at the top of the Chain and proceeding down to Chain Link 1

<p align="left">
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/">Official rulebook page 44</a>
</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Spell Speed

Every type of card effect has a Spell Speed between 1 and 3. If you want to respond to a card effect in a Chain, you have to use an effect with Spell Speed 2 or higher, and it cannot have a lower Spell Speed than the effect you are responding to.

Spell, Trap, and Effect Monster effects have different Spell Speeds. There are Spell Speeds from 1 to 3. You can only respond with an effect if it is Spell Speed 2 or higher, and has an equal or greater Spell Speed than the effect on the Chain Link before it.

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Spell Speed 1</th>
		<td>
			Includes:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Spells (Normal, Equip, Continuous, Field, Ritual),
				</li>
				<li>
					Effect Monster's effects (Ignition, Trigger, and Flip) 
				</li>
			</ul>
			This is the slowest of all Spell Speeds. These cards cannot be activated in response to any other effects. Typically, these effects cannot be Chain Link 2 or higher, unless multiple Spell Speed 1 effects are activated simultaneously.
		</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<th>Spell Speed 2</th>
		<td>
			Includes:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Traps (Normal, Continuous)
				</li>
				<li>
					Quick-Play Spells
				</li>
				<li>
					Effect Monster's Quick Effects
				</li>
			</ul>
			These cards can be used to respond to a Spell Speed 1 or 2 effect, and can typically be activated during any phase.
		</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<th>Spell Speed 3</th>
		<td>
			Includes:
			<ul>
				<li>
					Counter Trap
				</li>
			</ul>
			This is the fastest of all Spell Speeds and can be used to respond to a card of any Spell Speed. Only another Spell Speed 3 card may be used to respond to these cards.
		</td>
	</tr>	
</table>

</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Actions which cannot be Chained to

You can only create a Chain by responding to the activation of a card or effect. Summoning a monster, Tributing, changing a monster's battle position and paying costs are not effect activations and therefore you cannot respond to those actions using a Chain.

<p align="left">
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/">Official rulebook page 51</a>
</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Fast effect timing

### Turn Player's Priority

The turn player always starts with Priority, or the choice to activate a card first, in each phase or step of their turn. As long as the turn player has Priority, the opponent cannot activate cards or effects, except for effects that activate automatically, like Trigger or Flip effects. The turn player can either:
- Use Priority to play a card or activate an effect
- Pass Priority to the opponent so they can activate an effect.

A player must pass Priority to the opponent when moving on to the next phase or step. Strictly speaking, you would always declare that you're passing Priority before the end of every phase and step, and ask your opponent if they wish to play a card. However, for ease of play, announcing the end of your phases or steps implies giving up Priority. Therefore, when announcing the end of a phase, your opponent can just say "Before the end of your phase, I activate this card" and use a card. 
- The turn player starts with Priority to activate a card or effect first
- After a card's activation, and at the end of each phase or step, Priority passes to the opponent.

<p align="left">
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/">Official rulebook page 48</a>
</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Simultaneous Effects

#### Perform actions simultaneously

For cases like "Each player targets 1 monster," where both players resolve an effect simultaneously, the turn player resolves the effect first. In this example, after the turn player makes their selection, the other player makes theirs.

<p align="left">
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/">Official rulebook page 50</a>
</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### Simultaneous Effects Go On Chain (SEGOC)

If effects of Spell Speed 1 cards (like Trigger Effects) are activated at the same time, they will be resolved in a special Chain. This Chain is made starting with the turn player's mandatory effects. If there is only 1 effect, that will be Chain Link 1.

If there are 2 or more effects:

- The turn player builds the Chain starting with their mandatory effects, in any order.

- Then the opponent continues the Chain with their mandatory effects in any order.

- Afterwards, the turn player adds their optional effects in any order.

- And finally the opponent adds their optional effects in any order.

## Effects Glossary

### Attach

#### Attaching material affects the monster

If an effect (1) that involves attaching a card (2) as an Xyz Material to a Xyz Monster on the field (3) is activated, if (3) is unaffected by cards' effects, then (1) resolves without attaching (2) to (3), and (1) is sent to the Graveyard.

- [Example: "Overlay Regen", "Forbidden Lance"](https://db.ygoresources.com/qa#19)

<p align="left">
	<a target="_blank" href="https://db.ygoresources.com/qa#19">YGOrg Database of Official OCG Rulings</a>
</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Battle/Battled

A monster "battles" (and is "battling") starting from when it attacks or is attacked. This includes both monsters attacking other monsters, and monsters attacking a player's Life Points directly.

When a card requires a monster to have "battled" (past tense), the attack had to have reached the damage calculation portion of the Damage Step in order for the monster to have "battled". If the attack stops before damage calculation, the monster did not "battle". (Note that **an attack was still declared**, however, so in most cases the attacking monster cannot declare another attack.)

<p align="left">
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/">Official rulebook page 52</a>
</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Control/Possess

- Cards you "control" are the cards in your Monster Zone, Spell & Trap Zone, Field Zone, and Pendulum Zone.

- Cards in your "possession" include all cards you control, plus the cards in your hand, Deck, Extra Deck, Graveyard, your banished cards, cards in the middle of being Summoned to your side of the field, and Xyz Materials attached to monsters you control.

If a player takes control of a card from their opponent, move it to the new controller's side of the field. If sent to the Graveyard, or returned to the hand or Deck, it is always returned to the Graveyard/hand/Deck of the original owner.

<p align="left">
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/">Official rulebook page 53</a>
</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Destroy

A card is destroyed when it is sent to the Graveyard due to battle between monsters or by an effect that destroys a card. A card that is returned from the field to the hand or Deck, or, that is sent to the Graveyard as a cost or Tribute, is NOT considered "destroyed." always returned to the Graveyard/hand/Deck of the original owner.

<p align="left">
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/">Official rulebook page 53</a>
</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Discard

Discard means to send a card from your hand to the Graveyard. This can happen because of a card effect or by adjusting the number of cards in your hand during the End Phase.

<p align="left">
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/">Official rulebook page 53</a>
</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Equip Cards

In addition to Equip Spell Cards, sometimes Trap Cards or Monster Cards can become equipped to a monster.

- Equipped Traps remain Trap Cards

- Equipped monsters are considered to be Equip Spells.

The term "Equip Card" includes all 3 kinds (standard Equip Spells, equipped Traps, and monsters equipped to other monsters).

<p align="left">
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/">Official rulebook page 53</a>
</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### Equipped Monster

A monster that is equipped with an Equip Card is an "equipped monster." When this monster is destroyed or flipped face-down, the equipped card loses its target, and is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.

<p align="left">
	<a target="_blank" href="https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/rulebook/">Official rulebook page 54</a>
</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### Move equipped Monster Card to another target

If a Monster Card is equipped to another monster, it remains equipped to that monster and cannot be moved to a different target, even by card effects that would normally be able to do so.

**EXCEPTION**: Union monsters equipped by their own effects can be moved by appropriate card effects.

When a card says to "excavate" cards from your Deck, you reveal those cards to both players. Then, before you do anything else, apply the instructions from the card effect that excavated them. Cards that are being excavated are still treated as being in the Deck until sent elsewhere by the card instructions

### Leaves the field

Some monsters have effects that activate when they "leave the field". For example, these effects activate when the monster is sent to the Graveyard, or is banished, or is returned to the hand or Extra Deck.

When a monster on the field is shuffled into the Deck, or becomes an Xyz Material, it is no longer a card on the field, however its effects that activate when it "leaves the field" will not activate. Deck includes both Main and Extra Deck.

### Piercing Battle Damage

Some monsters can inflict piercing battle damage when they attack a Defense Position monster. This means that you inflict damage to your opponent's LP equal to the difference between the attacking monster's ATK and the defending monster's DEF.

</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Random

When a card effect says to choose a card randomly, there is no official way of doing so, it is fine as long as neither player has a way of knowing which card is being chosen.

</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Reveal

When an effect says to reveal a card, you show it to both players. You may have to reveal a face-down card, a card from your hand, or from the top of your Deck. Revealing a card does not activate the card or its Flip effect. Normally, revealed cards are returned to their original position after being looked at by both players.

</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Send to the Graveyard

A card can be sent to the Graveyard in various ways. Destroying a card, discarding, and Tributing a monster are all actions that send a card to the Graveyard, and will normally activate "When/If this card is sent to the
Graveyard..." Trigger Effects.

</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### Return to the Graveyard

When a banished card is moved to the Graveyard, it is not considered to be "sent to the Graveyard".

</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Tribute

Tributing is sending a monster you control to the Graveyard. You can Tribute a face-up or face-down monster, unless otherwise specified. Tributing a monster is one possible cost for Summoning a monster or activating an effect. A monster sent to the Graveyard by Tributing is not treated as "destroyed."

</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Unaffected

#### Attaching material affects the monster

If an effect (1) that involves attaching a card (2) as an Xyz Material to a Xyz Monster on the field (3) is activated, if (3) is unaffected by cards' effects, then (1) resolves without attaching (2) to (3), and (1) is sent to the Graveyard.

- [Example: "Overlay Regen", "Forbidden Lance"](https://db.ygoresources.com/qa#19)

## Effects Interaction

### Banishing a token is a conjunction success

If a Token's (1) propertis (Attribute, Type, ATK, DEF, Level...) satisfy a certain card's (2) activation requirement and (2) requires to banish a Monster with those properties, (2) can be activated. If (1) is banished because of (2)'s cost, (2) resolves normally even if (1) original properties were not originally the one necessary to fulfil the activation of (2).

- [Example: "DNA Surgery", "Dragon's Rebirth"](https://db.ygoresources.com/qa#275)

</p>
<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Location changes mid-chain

If a monster's Trigger Effect meets its activation conditions, BUT hasn't yet had a chance to actually activate yet (because it's still in the middle of a chain or card effect, for example) and is therefore being "saved for later", BUT its location* changes between the time its Trigger Effect activation is met, and the time it actually has a chance to activate, its effect does not activate. [*On the field, in the Graveyard, in the hand, banished, or in the Deck.]

-   [Example: "Drytron Alpha Thuban", "Cyber Angel Benten", "D.D. Crow"](https://db.ygoresources.com/qa#23251)

### Stats (ATK/DEF) modifiers

#### Categories and interactions

Any given modifier can fall under one of the following different categories:

1. Activated/Lingering effect modifier that increases/decreases the current ATK/DEF.

2. Non-activated/Continuous effect modifier that increases/decreases the current ATK/DEF.

3. Activated/Lingering effect modifier that sets current ATK/DEF to determined value.

4. Non-activated/Continuous effect modifier that sets current ATK/DEF to determined value.

5. Activated/Lingering effect modifier that sets original ATK/DEF to determined value.

6. Non-activated/Continuous effect modifier that sets original ATK/DEF to determined value.

Possible outcomes:

-  (x) are always applied successfully/Apply (x) after previous (5,6)

- Remove previous (y) when applying (x): apply (x) then when (x) stops applying the value will forget/won't apply anymore about (y)

- (y) are not reapplied until (x) stops applying

- Apply (x) and reapply (y) afterwards

- Apply new (x): overwrites previous (y) of the same kind, if (x) stops applying then (y) will return to apply

In the examples, the two cards on the left are the "Prev", the card on the right separated by the previous two is the "New": "→" signifies the value after the "New" effect is applied, "⇒" signifies the value after the "New" effect has stopped applying

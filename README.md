## ATK/DEF modifiers

[Pazim's Resources](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/tia8xzqafu1ibscz0gz95/AEx_Ri-wkJ9QE75AWRKn4RQ?preview=Judge+Resources.pdf&rlkey=z6uissqwewd81wm9c03zosaa3)

### Categories and interactions
Any given modifier can fall under one of the following different categories:
1. Activated/Lingering  effect modifier that increases/decreases the current ATK/DEF.

2. Non-activated/Continuous effect modifier that increases/decreases the current ATK/DEF.

3. Activated/Lingering effect modifier that sets current ATK/DEF to determined value.

4. Non-activated/Continuous effect modifier that sets current ATK/DEF to determined value.

5. Activated/Lingering effect modifier that sets original ATK/DEF to determined value.

6. Non-activated/Continuous effect modifier that sets original ATK/DEF to determined value.

Possible outcomes:

$\hspace{1em}$ðŸŸ¥ (x) are always applied successfully/Apply (x) after previous (5,6)

$\hspace{1em}$ðŸŸ§ Remove previous (y) when applying (x): apply (x) then when (x) stops applying the value will forget/won't apply anymore about (y)

$\hspace{1em}$ðŸŸ© (y) are not reapplied until (x) stops applying

$\hspace{1em}$ðŸŸ¦ Apply (x) and reapply (y) afterwards

$\hspace{1em}$ðŸŸ¨ Apply new (x): overwrites previous (y) of the same kind

Some examples:
    

### Special cases
For these special cases, no matter what the effects currently in play are, they are always applied last. If a new effect is applied, reapply
those effects right afterwards.\
When those effects stop applying, reapply everything, including lingering effects (1,3,5)

## Summons

### Summon restrictions and successful summons
[Source](https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/play/2021_rules_update/)

The restriction of "you cannot Normal or Special Summon the turn you activate this card" only refers to monsters that were successfully summoned. Same for "you can only Special Summon X once per turn" restrictions.

## Trigger effects

### Leaves the field
[Source](https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/play/2021_rules_update/)

When a monster on the field is shuffled into the Deck, or becomes an Xyz Material, it is no longer a card on the field, however its effects that activate when it "leaves the field" will not activate. Deck includes both Main and Extra Deck.

### Location changes mid-chain
[Source](https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/play/2021_rules_update/)

If a monsterâ€™s Trigger Effect meets its activation conditions, BUT hasnâ€™t yet had a chance to actually activate yet (because itâ€™s still in the middle of a chain or card effect, for example) and is therefore being "saved for later", BUT its location* changes between the time its Trigger Effect activation is met, and the time it actually has a chance to activate, its effect does not activate. [*On the field, in the Graveyard, in the hand, banished, or in the Deck.]

## ATK/DEF modifiers
[Source](https://ygorganization.com/atkdefmodifierguide/)

Any given modifier can fall under one of the following different categories:
1. Activated effect modifier that increases/decreases the current ATK/DEF.

2. Non-activated effect modifier that increases/decreases the current ATK/DEF.

3. Activated effect modifier that sets current ATK/DEF to determined value.

4. Non-activated effect modifier that sets current ATK/DEF to determined value.

5. Activated effect modifier that sets original ATK/DEF to determined value.

6. Non-activated effect modifier that sets original ATK/DEF to determined value.


## Summons

### Summon restrictions and successful summons
[Source](https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/play/2021_rules_update/)

The restriction of "you cannot Normal or Special Summon the turn you activate this card" only refers to monsters that were successfully summoned. Same for "you can only Special Summon X once per turn" restrictions.

## Trigger effects

### Leaves the field
[Source](https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/play/2021_rules_update/)

When a monster on the field is shuffled into the Deck, or becomes an Xyz Material, it is no longer a card on the field, however its effects that activate when it "leaves the field" will not activate. Deck includes both Main and Extra Deck.

### Location changes mid-chain
[Source](https://www.yugioh-card.com/en/play/2021_rules_update/)

If a monster’s Trigger Effect meets its activation conditions, BUT hasn’t yet had a chance to actually activate yet (because it’s still in the middle of a chain or card effect, for example) and is therefore being "saved for later", BUT its location* changes between the time its Trigger Effect activation is met, and the time it actually has a chance to activate, its effect does not activate. [*On the field, in the Graveyard, in the hand, banished, or in the Deck.]

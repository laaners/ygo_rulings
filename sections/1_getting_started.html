<ul>
  <li>Main Monster Zones</li>
  <li>Extra Monster Zones</li>
  <li>Spell &amp; Trap Zones</li>

<p>If an effect simply says &quot;Monster Zones&quot; without specifying Main or Extra Monster Zones, it affects both Main Monster Zones and Extra Monster Zones.</p>

This is where you put your monsters when they&#39;re played.
<ul>
  <li>You can have up to 5 cards here.</li>
  <li>
    There are 3 ways to position your Monster Cards:
    <ol>

      <li>Face-up Defense Position</li>
      <li>Face-down Defense Position</li>
    </ol>

  </li>
  <li>A monster placed in a Monster Zone cannot be moved to a different Monster Zone unless by an effect.</li>

<section-header level="4" id="extra-monster-zone">Extra Monster Zone</section-header>
<p>This is where you put your monsters that are Summoned to the field by special methods from the Extra Deck</p>
<ul>
  <li>Normally, each player can only use 1 of these Zones. A monster placed in this Zone does not count towards the 5-monster limit of your Main Monster Zone.</li>
  <li>
    Fusion, Synchro, and Xyz Monsters can be first Summoned from the Extra Deck to any of your Main Monster Zones<sup><a href="#extra_monster_zone-2">[2]</a></sup
    >. They do not have to be Summoned to the Extra Monster Zone or a spot that a Link Monster is pointing to. You can still Summon a Fusion/Synchro/Xyz Monster from the Extra Deck to your Extra Monster Zone if you want to, though.
  </li>
  <li>The restrictions requiring an Extra Monster Zone or Link Monster pointing still apply to Link Monsters and Pendulum Monsters that are Summoned from the Extra Deck.</li>
  <li>An Extra Monster Deck Zone in which no monster has been placed is not treated as either yours or the opponent&#39;s. Only if a monster is placed in a zone, that zone is treated as being a zone of the controller of that monster.</li>
  <li>Monsters that are not Special Summoned from the Extra Deck cannot be placed in the Extra Monster Zone.</li>
  <li>An Extra Monster Zone in which a monster has been placed is also treated as a Monster Zone of the controller of that monster.</li>
  <li>Monsters placed in the Extra Monster Zone cannot be moved to another zone unless an effect or resolution is applied.</li>
  <li>If a monster that has been Special Summoned from the Extra Deck into the Extra Monster Zone is later sent to the Graveyard or banished and later would be Special Summoned, it is not Special Summoned to the Extra Monster Zone and is Special Summoned into a Main Monster zone instead.</li>
  <li>The other Extra Monster Zone from the point of view of each Extra Monster Zone is not treated as &quot;the adjacent zone&quot;.</li>
  <li>
    If control of a monster in the Extra Monster Zone changes
    <ul>
      <li>If control of a monster placed in an Extra Monster Zone switches to the other player&#39;s field, it is placed in an available Main Monster Zone of the player who gained control.</li>
      <li>If control of a monster that was transfered to the opponent from an Extra Monster Zone returns, it is not placed in the original Extra Monster Zone, and it is placed in an available Main Monster Zone of the player who regained control. If there is no available Main Monster Zone, that monster is destroyed and sent to the Graveyard.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<section-header level="4" id="spell-trap-zone">Spell &amp; Trap Zone</section-header>
<p>This is where you put Spell &amp; Trap Cards.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can have up to 5 cards here.</li>
  <li>You place them here face-up to activate them, or place them face-down.</li>
  <li>A card placed in a Spell &amp; Trap Zone cannot be moved to a different Spell &amp; Trap Zone, unless by an effect.</li>
  <li>Since Field Spell Cards can only be placed in the Field Zone, they cannot be placed in the Spell &amp; Trap Zone.</li>
  <li>If a Monster Card is placed in the Spell &amp; Trap Zone by some effect or resolution, it is treated as a Spell or Trap Card (the effects will specify which kind of Spell or Trap).</li>
  <li>Pendulum Monster Cards can be activated in the leftmost and rightmost Zones as Spells. This causes the Zone you use to also become a Pendulum Zone for as long as the Pendulum Monster Card is there.</li>

<section-header level="4" id="pendulum-zone">Pendulum Zone</section-header>
<p>This is the place where Pendulum Monsters activated as Spell Cards are placed in. The left-most and right-most of the 5 Spell &amp; Trap Zones on the field are also treated as Pendulum Zones. However, they are only treated as Pendulum Zones as long as there is a Pendulum Monster in them that has been activated from the hand as a Spell Card on that has been placed in them by an effect that places cards in the Pendulum Zone. Furthermore, Pendulum Monsters placed here through these methods are treated as &quot;cards in the Pendulum Zone(s)&quot;.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The only places in which Pendulum Monsters can be activated as Spell Cards from the hand or placed by an effect that places cards in a Pendulum Zone are the left-most and right-most of the 5 Spell &amp; Trap Zones on the field.</li>
  <li>New cards cannot be placed in a Pendulum Zone that already has a card placed on it.</li>
  <li>Pendulum Monsters placed in the Pendulum Zone are not treated as monsters and are treated as Spell Cards, as well as cards in the Spell &amp; Trap Zone. But they are still &quot;Monster Cards&quot;.</li>
  <li>Only the Pendulum Monster cards that have been placed in a Pendulum Zone by being activated from the hand as Spell Cards or placed there by an effect that places cards in the Pendulum Zone are treated as &quot;cards in the Pendulum Zone&quot;. For example: A Pendulum Monster treated as an Equip Card by an effect like the effect of Relinquished that says which is placed in a Pendulum Zone is not treated as &quot;a card in the Pendulum Zone&quot;. Therefore, its Pendulum Effects cannot be used and a Pendulum Summon cannot be performed.</li>
  <li>Effects like Wavering Eyes that &quot;destroy all cards in the Pendulum Zones&quot; cannot destroy Pendulum Monsters that have been placed in the Pendulum Zones by methods other than being activated from the hand as a Spell Card or by being placed there by a card effect that places cards in the Pendulum Zone.</li>
  <li>If an Effect like the effect of Acrobatic Magician which says &quot;When this card is destroyed by battle: You can place this card in your Pendulum Zone&quot; places a card from outside the Pendulum Zone into a Pendulum Zone, it can place a card in either the left-most or right-most of the 5 Spell &amp; Trap Zones that is available. If a card is placed by this method, that zone is also treated as a Pendulum Zone, and the card placed there is also treated as &quot;a card in the Pendulum Zone&quot;.</li>

<p>Special Spell Cards called Field Spell Cards are played here (activated face-up or set face-down).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Each player can have 1 Field Spell Card on their own side of the field.</li>
  <li>To use another Field Spell, send your previous one to the Graveyard.</li>
  <li>
    Field Spell Cards do not count towards the 5-card limit of your Spell &amp; Trap Zone: they are not treated as cards in the Spell &amp; Trap Zone, for example:
    <ul>
      <li>The effect of &quot;Treeborn Frog&quot; that can be activated if &quot;You must control no Spell/Trap Cards to activate and to resolve this effect.&quot; cannot be activated if there is a Field Spell Card.</li>
      <li>The effect of &quot;Snow Plow Hustle Rustle&quot; that says &quot;When your opponent&#39;s monster declares a direct attack, if you control a card(s) in your Spell &amp; Trap Card Zone:&quot; cannot be activated if the only Spell &amp; Trap Cards you control are in your Field Zone.</li>
    </ul>

<p>When Monster Cards are destroyed, and when Spell &amp; Trap Cards are used, they&#39;re sent face-up to this space.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The contents of both players&#39; Graveyards are public knowledge: you and your opponent can look through both at any time during the Duel.</li>
  <li>The order of the cards in the Graveyard should not be changed.</li>
  <li>Graveyard is shortened in the card text to &quot;GY&quot;.</li>
  <li>If multiple cards are sent to the Graveyard simultaneously, it is the owner of those cards that decides the order in which they are placed in the Graveyard, regardless of the controller of the effect.</li>
  <li>If cards are sent to the Graveyard, they are always sent to the owner&#39;s Graveyard.</li>
